Few homes feel perfect without a quality deck or patio. Wooden decks are especially popular and can add a feeling of class to a home’s backyard. If you plan ahead, you can even build a deck that seamlessly connects to a pool, a tennis court, or some other awesome activity space add-on. Even if you go with a non-wooden deck or patio, you’re sure to see some amazing results. 

# 2. Backyard Pavilion

Alongside decks and patios, pavilions are fantastic for creating an outdoor hang-out space. If you want, you can even add a pavilion to an already-existing deck or patio to truly spruce up your home’s exterior space. Finding the right style and material for your pavilion is key, however. Currently, [ timber frame pavilions are all the rage](https://www.gazebokits.com/pavilions/timber-frame-pavilions/jefferson-county-wv/){data-affiliate="734"}, and can seriously up your home’s equity value.

# 5. Mudroom Add-on 

Do you live out in the country? Maybe you just love outdoor activities? If so, adding a mudroom to your home is a no-brainer. Not only will this ensure you don’t muddy up the rest of your home, but it will give you plenty of space to store your outdoor toys and tools as well.

# 6. Landscaping Redo

Not all home equity projects are as simple as a single idea. Some of them reimagine the entire aesthetic and style of your property. If you want to make the exterior of your home, and landscape, truly *yours*, you should consider a large-scale landscaping redo project. You can add gardens, shrubs, and more to truly spruce up your home’s outdoor spaces. 

# 7. Home Elevator

If you live in a home that’s more than two stories tall, a home elevator can make it both more accessible, and more valuable. Nowadays, home elevators are cheaper to install than ever before, so if you’ve been waiting to pull the trigger on a home elevator project, the time is now. Just be sure to consider what you’ll be using your elevator for beforehand, as there are many different types of home elevator designs to choose from.

# 9. Home Office

Home offices are one of the most valuable and *useful* home equity projects you can invest in as of 2022. In a post-pandemic world, home offices ensure that you’ll always have a cozy, properly set up space to do work in. If you’re aiming to work from home whenever humanly possible, this project becomes that much more valuable. 

# 10. Fashionable Front Door 

While it may seem simple, adding a quality front door to your home can actually greatly boost its home equity value. Choose a stylish, trendy front door style, and you’ll make your home’s entrance look more impressive (and high-class) than you ever thought possible. 

## Improve Your Home (and its Equity) 

Every home improvement project you do has the potential to skyrocket your home’s equity value. By combining this investment with a project that you’ll enjoy for the rest of your life, you can make an investment that you’ll never, ever regret.
