Few things in life are as stressful and chaotic as moving. Especially if you have a ton of belongings, moving can seem like a Herculean task. Thankfully, there are many easy ways to simplify the moving process and to ensure that it goes as smoothly as humanly possible. For any stressed soon-to-be movers out there, here are twelve moving cheat codes you should know about: 

# 1. Preparation is *Everything*

If you want a successful, easy move, you need to have *everything possible* planned out ahead of time. If you fail to do so, you’ll find yourself dealing with a million little extra tasks along the way. Additionally, you could find yourself dealing with extra costs that could throw off your moving budget. 

# 2. Professionals are Available 

If you have a hard time with heavy lifting, or you simply want to take the edge off of your move, you need to seriously consider [hiring a professional Atlanta moving team](https://peachtreemovers.com){data-affiliate="713"} to help you get the job done. Let them take on the hard tasks, and you can focus on where you want each and every item you’re moving to be within your brand-new home. 

# 3. Create a Moving Folder

Having a “moving folder” can make your move way simpler. Include all the plans for your move, a list of all of your belongings (especially valuable ones), know where you’ll [rent a car](https://www.discovercars.com/){data-affiliate="714"} or a moving truck, moving insurance, leases, and other important moving documents in this folder for the best results. Having this folder can help you navigate any unforeseen problems in the future in a much easier fashion. 

# 4. Pack Ahead of Time

If you wait until a few days before you move to [*actually pack*](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/experts-guide-to-packing/index.html){data-affiliate="715"}, you’ll be putting yourself in an incredibly stressful situation. Not only this, but you’ll be increasing the risk that you lose or forget important items as well. To avoid unnecessary problems, *always* pack everything you need as ahead of time as possible. 

# 5. Declutter and Make Some Cash

Organizing your belongings ahead of your move is a given. However, if you can simultaneously declutter your belongings, you’re in for many advantages. Not only will this allow you to get rid of unwanted belongings, but it will give you the opportunity to donate and/or sell those items as well. 

# 6. Move Utilities Ahead of Time

Many people forget some of the most important moving tasks have nothing to do with your personal belongings. [Moving your utilities and mailing address](https://fifti-fifti.net/utilities/6-things-to-do-when-moving-into-a-new-house/){data-affiliate="716"} before the move takes place will save you a *ton* of hassle in the long run, so be sure to do so at least a week pre-move-in. 

# 7. Know Your Moving Needs

If you’re not 100% certain about your moving needs, you need to sit down and make an exhaustive list. Even after you’ve made the first draft of your moving plans, reevaluating them to see if you have any additional moving needs is highly recommended (and can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run). 

# 8. Avoid Half-Packed Boxes

Packing is an art. If you’ve never packed a ton of belongings at once before, you’ll be surprised at how complicated the process actually is. Above all else, however, it’s important to keep your packing efficient. By avoiding half-packed boxes, you can ensure that you’re minimizing the amount of space you'll need in moving trucks. 

# 9. Label *Everything*

In addition to avoiding half-packed boxes, you’ll want to carefully (and clearly) label every box you pack. Make sure to mark sensitive materials as “fragile” during this time, especially if you’re hiring a moving service. When it comes time to begin unpacking your belongings, you’ll be incredibly glad that you took the time to properly label them. 

# 10. Tape Up Every Box

Once you have all boxes filled and labeled, it’s time to tape up every single one of them. Doing so will ensure that materials do not get loose or spill out in the moving truck, or during the moving process in general. Protecting your valuables during this stage is of utmost importance, after all. 

# 11. Organize Your Wardrobe 

Even before you pack, you should take the time to reorganize your wardrobe. For a lot of people, their wardrobes will be kept separate from other belongings. Even so, having them clearly organized and labeled understandably will end up proving invaluable. 

# 12. Keep Electronics Secure 

Lastly, you must take extra precautions about packing up, storing, and moving any electronic devices you have. If you purchase mover’s insurance, you’ll have much less stress while moving electronics and other valuables, so put a lot of thought into whether or not you can afford valuable movers insurance before finalizing your moving plans. 

## Embrace Change

As you prepare for your move, be sure to embrace the (hopefully) positive life change you’re about to experience. The more stress-free you can make the experience, the better. With these twelve moving cheat codes, you can make this the easiest, most successful move of your lifetime.
