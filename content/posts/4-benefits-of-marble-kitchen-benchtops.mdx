Various stone materials are available for kitchen benchtops (or countertops – depending on whether you're from the Oceanic region or not), such as sandstone, granite, and marble, making choosing one of them extremely difficult. You need to weigh all the pros and cons of each to reach a decision.

[Kitchen decor](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/how-to-decorate-your-kitchen/){data-affiliate="551"} requires most of your time while constructing the renovation strategy. Amongst all the variants in kitchen tops, marble is the most preferred. If you are someone looking for a [**new marble benchtop install**](https://www.unitedstonemelbourne.com.au/marble-kitchen-benchtops/){data-affiliate="552"}, it is important to remember to invest in a reputable brand with good customer reviews. In this article, you will learn about the benefits of using marble for your kitchen benchtop.

## Four Benefits of Marble Benchtops in the Kitchen

### Marble Benchtops are Heat Resistant

Heat resistance is one of the essential properties of every stone used in the kitchen, especially on the benchtop. Marble has a high heat tolerance capacity, making it a perfect choice for kitchen benchtops. It can also be used for bathroom benchtops for enhanced aesthetics.

### Durability

Marble from reputed brands is resistant to scratches, stains, and cracks, thus making it a suitable choice for kitchen countertops. In fact, it is also more durable than granite and sandstone. 

### Low Maintenance

Due to their porous nature, natural stones retain stains, chemicals, and water, causing them to weaken over time. Marble countertops are non-porous, making them easy to clean with soap and water, and they do not retain any stains. Make sure you use gentle products- harsh ones can dull their shine.

### Customisable

Marble can be customised in virtually any colour or pattern you desire, and because it cuts easily, it can fit any shape or size. No matter what kind of renovation project you have in mind for your kitchen, this engineered stone will meet all of your requirements. Some countertop slabs are also designed to look like natural stones such as granite and sandstone. So if you're rocking some [nice turquoise decor](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/turquoise-kitchen-decor/){data-affiliate="553"}, you can have your marble benchtop to match.

## Factors to Consider When Purchasing Kitchen Benchtops

### Benchtop Shape and Size

Renovating or remodelling is always a great idea. People have always been interested in having the freedom to add attachments to their kitchens to enhance their functionality and appeal.

While choosing the trendiest material and design, you should consider the size and shape of the benchtop. Choosing the wrong option will permanently ruin the overall appearance of your kitchen and thwart your [renovation plans](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-to-renovate-a-kitchen/){data-affiliate="554"}.

### The Durability of the Material

Trying to determine the material's durability is no easy task. Bench tops should consistently be rated for their capacity to support a given amount of weight. Taking into account aspects like the material's resistance to heat, shock, and sudden impact is essential.

### Benchtop Cost

The quality of the material and durability will always determine the value of the bench top. Better quality means a more expensive product. A material's price and warranty should always be incorporated into its cost.

## Go with Marble Benchtops

For kitchen renovations, a **new marble benchtop to install** is always the best option, and it has acquired an irreplaceable top position among other materials. Kitchens with marble bench tops are both luxurious and beautiful. You do not need to worry about staining or cracking them accidentally. Hopefully, this guide cleared your doubts and helped you decide whether you should opt for a marble benchtop.
