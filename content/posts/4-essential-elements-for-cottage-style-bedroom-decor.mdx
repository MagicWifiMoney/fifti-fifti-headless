One of the most popular bedroom styles among [home decor lovers](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/the-8-best-gifts-for-home-decor-lovers/){data-affiliate="410"} today is the cottage style. This look can vary widely depending on your personal preferences, but there are some essential elements that every cottage-style bedroom should have. In this blog post, we'll go over those critical pieces so you can create a charming and relaxing retreat in your own home. Keep reading to master cottage decor for your bedroom!

## **What Is Cottage-Style Decor?**

Traditionally, cottages are small, quaint dwellings located in rural areas. They have roots in many cultures but are perhaps best known for their prevalence in the English feudal period. Cottages were occupied by people who worked the land of a wealthy manor in exchange for the small dwelling.

Today, the term "cottage"  is used to describe various property types, but the one constant is that cottage-style decor should evoke feelings of comfort, relaxation, and simplicity.

This [emerging home design trend](https://www.texasrealestatesource.com/blog/texas-home-design-trends/){data-affiliate="411"} is all about creating a cozy and inviting space. It should be a place to kick back and relax, away from the hustle and bustle.

Cottage-style decor draws its inspiration from these humble abodes and often features cozy furnishings, vintage finds, and natural materials.

## **Go Hunting For Vintage Furniture & Decor**

One of the defining characteristics of cottage-style decor is vintage furniture and decor. Cottage-style bedrooms are often furnished with antique beds, dressers, nightstands, and armoires. Feel free to [mix and match furniture](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/mix-match-living-room-furniture/){data-affiliate="412"} and get creative. 

If you don't have any vintage pieces in your home, you can easily find them at flea markets, garage sales, or thrift stores.

For perfect accordance with the humble cottage style, browse your personal belongings for heirlooms with significant personal meaning.

Prioritize comfort and sentiment beyond cohesiveness. Don't worry as much about making sure everything matches. If every piece of furniture or decor you bring into your bedroom has a practical or emotional function, it fits your cottage-style bedroom's vibe.

Furthermore, you can always repaint furniture to make it match your bedroom.

## **Create Texture With Paneled Walls & Reclaimed Wood**

Another popular feature in cottage-style bedrooms is paneled walls. This can be anything from beadboard to reclaimed barn wood or shiplap.

Paneled walls add texture and interest to a room, and they're also a great way to cover up any imperfections in your walls. If you don't want to panel your entire bedroom, you can always use paneling on the lower half of your walls or as a wainscoting.

Consider using reclaimed wood in your cottage-style bedroom if you're looking for a rustic touch. Reclaimed wood can be used for everything from floors and walls to furniture and decor. There are many benefits to using reclaimed wood. It's environmentally friendly because it's recycled, and it also has a unique texture that can't be artificially recreated.

## **Bring the Garden In With Florals & Botanicals**

You can pay homage to the small gardens that came standard with many feudal cottages by incorporating florals and botanicals into your bedroom design.

An easy way to get started is by bringing fresh-cut flowers into your bedroom. Sound expensive? It doesn't have to be. Instead of spending money on floral arrangements from a store, pluck some flowers from a nearby forest or, even better, your backyard garden.

Of course, live plants will wilt and can't be found every season. That's where floral prints come into play.  You can find these prints on everything from bedding and curtains to wallpaper and rugs. You can complement these prints by painting the ways in a pale green or light rosy pink.

## **Get the Cottage-Style Lighting Right**

The lighting in your cottage-style bedroom should be soft and inviting. Avoid harsh fluorescent lighting, and opt for lamps with warm light bulbs instead.

If you have the opportunity, take advantage of natural light by placing your bed near a window. If not, consider adding a skylight to your bedroom to let in some extra light.

Flickering light sources like a fireplace or several candles will best solidify the cozy cottage aesthetic in your bedroom.

## **Cozy Up In Your Cottage-Style Bedroom**

Although cottage-style bedrooms are often thought of as being in a rural setting, this look can be adapted to fit any home. You can create a charming bedroom that feels like a cozy getaway by using vintage furniture and decor, creating texture with paneled walls and reclaimed wood, and adding floral and botanical accents. And don’t forget the most important element – the lighting! Get it right, and your bedroom will be irresistible. Have you tried these tips for your own cottage-style bedroom?
