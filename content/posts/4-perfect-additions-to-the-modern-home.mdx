Making your home exactly the way you want it won’t happen overnight. You will, of course, want something reflective of yourself, but at the same time, you also want something practical and worth the money you might be pouring into it, especially if you happen to be going for a full-blown renovation. 

This can be challenging, especially when figuring out what works best together, but some items are almost guaranteed to make the perfect addition to what you have now. 

## **#1 Instant boil tap**

You will find that having an instant boil tap is not just incredibly convenient; it can also help you [save water](https://www.liveabout.com/conservation-efforts-why-should-we-save-water-3157877){data-affiliate="992"} by only boiling exactly what you need. It can make catering so much more efficient, and it can also be great for cleaning, as well as saving you room on the sides. In addition, it has the benefit of being a cool little gadget to show off to your friends and family, which is not to be underestimated. 

## **#2 Aluminum bi-folding doors **

Aluminum is a great material to have for both doors and windows. It can help you to keep heat in the building, and they won’t rot away or flake over time. Stylistically, they can go with a huge number of interiors and exteriors, which can be great if you can’t decide what you want. 

Not only will they last for a long time, but if you live in an area that struggles with harsh weather, you will find that aluminum doors can go a long way to keeping that at bay. These are a long-term investment, so by getting them professionally installed by businesses such as [Now Aluminium](https://nowaluminium.co.uk/){data-affiliate="993"}, you will get the quality you pay for. 

## **#3 LED Lights **

If you haven’t made the switch already, you should be using [LEDs](https://www.sitelogiq.com/blog/10-advantages-led-lighting/){data-affiliate="994"}. You will quickly find that this can help you to save money on bills, light rooms more effectively, and save money on lightbulbs. This can make all the difference to your interior design choices as they give off a white accent light rather than a yellow or orange, which can bring out the real colors in your rooms, just like sunlight would. This can also help with ‘tired’ eyes or failing eyesight, as you won’t have to worry about squinting in dark corners.

## **#4 Portable air conditioning unit**

Although temperatures vary from country to country, sometimes, it can be nice to have air conditioning. A lot of buildings weren’t built for the heat and were mainly focused on keeping warmth in during winter. This is why walls can be so thick in older buildings. This can make summer unbearable for some, especially due to the high humidity. Getting a portable air conditioning unit can give you relief, and if you choose wisely, you will be able to get one that is multipurpose, meaning that you can use it during all times of the year. 

If you want to achieve a modern home, these are the four additions that you need to make to achieve this aesthetic.
