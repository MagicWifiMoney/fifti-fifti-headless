When looking at most high-end designs, it's easy to think having a stylish kitchen is unattainable without investing a[ fortune in a kitchen makeover](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/smart-spending/how-much-does-it-cost-to-remodel-kitchen.aspx){data-affiliate="616"}. However, you can apply similar design principles to your modest kitchen and get a stylish look on a tight budget. As long as your kitchen is practical, you can make a few strategic upgrades for an elegant appearance.

## **1. Repaint Your Cabinets and Replace The Handles**

Maybe you are holding off the idea of sprucing up your dated and unattractive cabinets because you feel it's too expensive to install new ones. A fresh coat of attractive paint is the easiest way to make old kitchen cabinets look unique and lively on a budget. However, it's critical to use specialist paint to[ ensure a durable, high-end finish](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/8-tips-for-a-functional-and-stylish-small-kitchen/){data-affiliate="617"}, otherwise, it will look poor with age.

Swapping out your broken handles seems like a minor and insignificant fix, but it can create a huge impression. Your choice depends on your budget, but the knobs cost a fraction of what you'd spend replacing the doors. Whether you want a rustic or sleek metallic touch, handles can bring style and class to your kitchen.

## **2. Add Modern Lighting An Elegant Splashback**

Beautiful lighting fixtures can transform your kitchen appearance instantly when you want to[ sell your house and get paid](https://www.ohiocashbuyers.com/blog/how-do-you-get-paid-when-selling-your-house/){data-affiliate="618"}. Add a statement pendant to get the desired effect if your lighting fixtures are dull or don't make a difference. A stylish splashback is a budget-friendly way to give your kitchen an elegant touch on a budget. Look for bright colors and unique patterns to make a striking impression. You can get excellent DIY designs on a budget if you don't want to have someone install a custom splashback in your kitchen.

## **3. Invest in Elegant Small Appliances and Accessorize With Copper**

Not every small appliance in your kitchen deserves a permanent spot. Once you choose the appliances to keep on display, invest in a version that looks stunning. The cost may be higher, but you don't have to replace everything at once. Focus on what brings more beauty to your kitchen. Copper accessories are[ trendy in the interior design space](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/trendy-kitchen-remodel-ideas-that-you-must-try/){data-affiliate="619"} and give your kitchen an expensive feel. You can furnish your open storage and shelves with attractive cookware to add sophistication to your kitchen design.

## **4. Declutter the Countertop and Clear the Fridge**

Most people decorate their fridge door with stickers, art, photographs, and postcards stuck with magnets. However, if you want the coveted expensive look, it's essential to clear the fridge to give the space a crisp touch. And while it doesn't cost a dime, clearing the fridge goes a long way in enhancing your kitchen's aesthetics.

Clutter can make your kitchen feel small and low-end, but going minimalist on your worktops makes your kitchen look elegant. Eliminate any toys, shopping lists, paper, and unnecessary items. Additionally, clear out rarely-used items and look for ingenious kitchen storage ideas to make the kitchen neat.

## **Endnote**

Giving your kitchen elegance and ambiance doesn't have to be a considerable investment. Even when your kitchen is dated and looks small, there are simple, inexpensive ways to make it look expensive and luxurious. Decluttering, repainting, and investing in a few signature pieces can transform your kitchen into a lovely space.
