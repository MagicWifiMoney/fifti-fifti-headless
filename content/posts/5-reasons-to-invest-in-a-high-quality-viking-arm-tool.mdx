No matter what industry you are in, there is always a need for high-quality tools. If you are looking for a tool that can help you get the job done right, you should consider investing in a [Viking Arms](https://oryxtools.com){data-affiliate="413"} tool. These tools are here to help you get the most out of your workday. Here are five reasons why you should invest in a Viking arm tool.

## What Is a Viking Arm Tool?

A Viking arm tool jack is a device that uses hydraulics to raise and lower a load. The jack consists of a metal frame, a [hydraulic](https://medium.com/@vcompmississaug/what-are-single-acting-double-acting-hydraulic-cylinders-817d6e6f30a8){data-affiliate="414"} cylinder, and a pump. The frame is mounted on the side of the vehicle, and the cylinder is attached to the frame.

The pump generates hydraulic pressure, which is used to raise the load. The load is lowered by releasing the pressure from the pump. The jack is used to raise and lower loads such as Heavy Equipment, Trailers, Boats, RVs, and 5th Wheels. It is also used to level vehicles that are not level.

The jack can be operated by hand or with a power drill. The power drill makes operating the jack easier and raises and lowers the load.

- **Backed by a Lifetime Warranty**
