The average homeowner spends between $5000 and $9000 each year on home decor. But not everyone can afford to splurge. DIY is the solution because it gives you a chance to redo your decor without breaking the bank. 

Are you a DIY enthusiast looking to spruce up your living space on a budget? You don't have to look any further. We will provide you with five tasteful and affordable decor ideas that will inspire you and transform your home. 

Whether you're a seasoned crafter or a first-time DIYer, these ideas will inspire and impress. With our cost-effective suggestions, you can achieve stunning results for a fraction of the price. Prepare to channel your inner artist and create a home that reflects your distinct style.

## **Start with a painting project**

Grab a can of your favorite paint color, put on some music, and give your walls a new coat of awesomeness. A [fresh coat of paint](https://www.bhg.com/how-often-should-you-paint-your-house-6747471){data-affiliate="1102"} can completely transform the feel of a room, making it feel larger, cozier, or more vibrant. 

Painting is like therapy for your walls, giving them a much-needed facelift. Think beyond the boring beige walls, and deck them with a splash of colors.

## **Redo your furniture placement**

People get used to a certain layout at home, but rearranging can bring new life into a space. Move that sofa to the opposite wall, replace your coffee table with a funky side table, or turn that empty corner into a play zone for your kids. 

Change up your furniture arrangement, and your space will feel new. You will be strutting around like an interior designer.

## **Create a gallery wall**

It is a simple way to incorporate your style and display your favorite photos, artwork, and funky posters. Gather a collection of mismatched frames from a thrift store and arrange them on a wall in a cluster that reflects your personality. You can check the art pieces at [abstractwallart.com.au](https://abstractwallart.com.au/abstract-landscape-prints/){data-affiliate="1103"} to embrace the abstract trend. Mix and match different sizes, colors, and textures to create a gallery wall fit for an Instagram photoshoot.

## **Bring in some greens**

Plants are the ultimate low-cost decor accessory. They add a splash of color and purify the air to create a soothing atmosphere. 

So, head to your local nursery, pick up some low-maintenance green babies like snake plants or pothos, and scatter them around your place. To show off your green thumb, get creative with funky pots or DIY hanging planters.

## **Set a reading nook**

Setting up a [cozy reading nook](https://www.thespruce.com/essentials-for-a-reading-nook-7371648){data-affiliate="1104"} helps you to escape reality and get lost in a good book. Find a quiet spot in your home, place a comfortable armchair or a cozy bean bag, and pile on fluffy cushions and a soft throw. 

Add a small side table for your favorite drinks and snacks. All you need is some creativity and DIY effort to design a reading nook perfect for unwinding and getting lost in fictional worlds.

You can channel your inner design specialist with these low-cost DIY decorating ideas. They promise to transform your space without spending big or investing lots of time and effort in the project.
