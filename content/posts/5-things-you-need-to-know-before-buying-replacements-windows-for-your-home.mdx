It's inevitable that sooner or later, your windows will need to be replaced. When they do, you should consider a few things before making the purchase. Keep reading to find out more. Here are five things you need to know about replacement windows.

## Window styles

Many [styles of windows](https://www.panda-windows.com/){data-affiliate="3166"} are available nowadays, including casement windows, single-hung windows, double-hung windows, picture windows, and of course most turn to [custom windows](https://www.panda-windows.com/) for the best options. Each type offers a different look and function, so choosing the one that will work best in your home is important. For example, picture windows are an excellent choice for those who want a larger window that offers unobstructed views. 

Casement windows are ideal for areas where you want a ventilating window that can be easily opened and closed. There are countless other options available as well. All serve different purposes for homeowners; be sure to do your research and find out what style is right for your home.

## Energy efficiency

Energy Star-compliant windows can save you as much as $175 a year in energy costs as compared to standard windows! This can add up over the life of your windows, so it's important to look for energy-efficient options that will reduce your energy bill and save you money in the long run. 

When [shopping for new windows](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/windows/window-replacement-cost/){data-affiliate="3167"}, it's often a good idea to look for a "Climate Zone" rating that is associated with a particular region of the country. The better your climate zone rating is, the more efficient your windows will be. So keep in mind these ratings when selecting your new windows to ensure you get the best value for your money.

## Installation costs

The cost of installing new windows can really add up fast. However, there are ways to significantly reduce the cost without compromising the quality of the job.

You can also find great deals on replacement parts by visiting the local hardware store rather than buying those windows straight from the manufacturer. There are plenty of ways to save on your window installation costs. You just need to be willing to put in the time and effort to do so.
