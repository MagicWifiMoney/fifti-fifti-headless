Entertaining used to happen mainly inside homes, but it was more for aesthetics than anything else. However, today, the growing indoor-outdoor lifestyle has shifted more activity outside, and you can up the[ value of your home](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/8-simple-tips-to-increase-the-value-of-your-home/){data-affiliate="620"} by enhancing outdoor spaces. 

Furnishing areas beyond the four walls is more important than ever, but choosing the right outdoor furniture can be difficult. While buying outdoor furniture involves the same process as purchasing indoor furniture, there are a few things to consider before purchasing your new pieces. Here are some tips for buying outdoor furniture.

## 1. Know your size and seating capacity

Size is the most critical aspect to consider when buying your outdoor furniture.[ Patio furniture](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2022/09/04/best-patio-furniture/?sh=5a015fda2d01){data-affiliate="621"} comes in different sizes and expandible options to accommodate guests. Allow 18 to 24 inches per guest for greater ease and fewer spills when dining. Generally, there should be between 6 and 12 inches between place settings. Since dining tables are typically 28 to 30 inches tall, the perfect height of your chairs should be between 18 to 20 inches from the ground to the top of your seat.

## 2. Find dual-purpose outdoor furniture

Look for dual-purpose furniture to make the most of your budget and space. Pieces that serve multiple purposes can cancel the need to buy extra furniture and allow more space for your favorite outdoor activities. For instance, a garden stool or ottoman from[ Kasala](https://www.kasala.com/){data-affiliate="622"} can provide additional patio seating for quests.    

## 3. Determine what you need

Before getting any outdoor furniture, figure out how you would like your outdoor space to function and what kind of outdoor furniture suits your lifestyle best. For instance, determine whether you want a large outdoor dining table to share with family and friends or just a comfortable outdoor lounge chair to escape when you want to read. If you want something a bit fancier, choose a bar table with a barstool instead or build your own outer piece to ensure your new outdoor furniture is crafted particularly for your space.

## 4. Choose your build material

Durability and personal preference are two essential aspects to consider when choosing the build material for outdoor furniture. Patio furniture comes in different materials, including aluminum, concrete, copper, steel, teak, and even wicker. Some materials, such as aluminum and steel, are sturdier and will last for decades, while wicker and copper are more fragile and may only last for a few years. Therefore, when you [buy furniture in Singapore](https://www.starliving.com.sg/collections/living-room){data-affiliate="623"}, be sure to pick the material that is appropriate for your purpose.

## 5. Match colors to your outdoor décor

You are not limited to neutral colors or the natural tones of wood when buying outdoor furniture. Wood, metal, and wicker pieces come with a wide range of colorful finishes, so choose furnishings that emphasize colors in your[ landscaping](https://gharpedia.com/blog/front-yard-landscaping-ideas/){data-affiliate="624"}, your home's exterior, and other outdoor décors. A[ DIY paint job](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/5-tips-for-the-perfect-finish-when-painting-your-patio-furniture/){data-affiliate="625"} can perk up your outdoor furniture with any hue if the right color isn't available.

## Endnote

Choosing the perfect outdoor furniture for your needs isn't always easy. You will need to consider every aspect, such as the size and amount of seating you need and the ease of cleaning and protection you are looking for. However, these tips can help you bring life back outside, whether you want to host a dinner party, have an outdoor space for games or create a welcoming sanctuary for morning coffee.
