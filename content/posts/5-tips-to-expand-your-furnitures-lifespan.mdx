Buying wooden furniture requires a lot of research from your end. But, once you find that unique piece of wooden craftsmanship, you know it’s special for you. Maybe, that’s because you have a special memory of it. Or, perhaps it’s because you have bought it from high-quality brands like [Vanguard furniture by SC](https://stephaniecohenhome.com/collections/vanguard-furniture){data-affiliate="3596"}.

Whatever the reason behind your love for your furniture is, you need to take care of it, for instance, when moving home you should always use a professional company like [Newcastle Removals](https://morethanremovals.co.uk/){data-affiliate="3597"} to protect your furniture.

With regular maintenance, you can make your furniture live longer than ten years. But, there are some things that you must follow to ensure a long life. Here, in this article, are the top four tips that you can follow.

### 1. Keep Furniture Away from Direct Sunlight and Heat

Heat or direct sunlight has always been a bad thing for furniture in your home. Whether it is a sofa, a dining table, or a desk, never place it near the hottest spot. Also, avoid keeping them near the window, where maximum sunlight comes in. The heat of any type will damage and fade the colors of your furniture sooner than it should.

Besides that, you should also remember to always use coasters and trays for mugs or glasses having hot beverages. Never keep them directly on top of your wooden [coffee tables](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/decorate-round-coffee-table/){data-affiliate="376"} and appliances to avoid heat and spill damage. The same goes for hot food.

### 2. Regularly Dust Your Wooden Appliances

As dust particles settle on top of your [furnishings](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/mix-match-living-room-furniture/){data-affiliate="377"}, they scratch the surface. Thus, use a soft cotton cloth to dust regularly. 

In that way, you can guarantee that dust or dirt never accumulates on the surface areas in the first place. Also, avoid using harsh clothes or rough ones to keep your appliances shiny and free of scratches.

### 3. Implement Regular Pest Control to Safeguard Your Furniture

Pests like termites and wood beetles can be a real threat to wooden furniture, silently causing damage from within. To protect your furniture from these destructive pests, it's important to implement regular pest control measures. For effective protection, especially against termites, contacting professional [termite control](https://www.billstermiteco.com/){data-affiliate="3593"} services for annual inspections is crucial. These experts can detect early signs of infestation, preventing damage before it becomes severe.Additionally, consider using natural repellents like cedar blocks or essential oils such as lavender, which are known to deter pests. Placing these around your furniture can help keep the pests away.

### 4. Periodical Deep Cleaning is Necessary

Living in a dusty environment might make dry-cleaning a frustrating job for you. The moment you finish dusting, you find a fresh layer of dust within an hour. Therefore, the best thing to do is wet cleaning in such cases. And all you need is a soft cotton cloth and a furniture cleaner spray. Using that, you can ensure that dust stays away for a longer time.

However, if you have stains or spots, you can do deep cleaning. Use liquid dishwashing soap and a soft cotton cloth to erase odd marks. After finishing off, use a damp cloth and wipe away the dirt. That’s all you need to do to get the shiny look back.

### 5. Polish Furniture to Protect the Wood

Did you know that the top layer keeps wearing away every time you dry or deep-clean your furniture? It is crucial to re-polish your products and apply wax or varnish coating. You can keep the shine, polish, and top layer safe for longer years by doing this. 

However, be careful before using alcohol-containing polishes. They can damage some of the wood finishes.

## Protect Your Furniture to Extend Its Lifespan

Maintaining your wooden appliances’ beauty is not tough if you regularly take care of them. Also, if you have bought your product from a reputed brand, you can easily keep it intact for more than 10 to 15 years. In fact, that is what you get buying from any top reputed brand.
