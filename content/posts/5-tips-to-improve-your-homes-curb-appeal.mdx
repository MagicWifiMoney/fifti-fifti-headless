If you have been thinking of renovating your home, you’ve probably begun making plans for the interior. However, it’s important to think about the exterior as well!

It’s the first thing people see when they visit or pass by, and it can significantly affect your property's value. While it can seem daunting, breaking the process into smaller tasks can help you get started.

Interested in learning more? Below we are going to discuss some tips to help you improve your home’s curb appeal.

## **Upgrade Windows and Doors**

Your windows and doors are the most essential part of the home’s exterior. Clean them regularly, repair any issues, or upgrade them completely if required.

It’s also essential that you maintain your garage door system so that it remains in excellent condition. The team at [Canadoor Garage Doors](http://www.canadoorsystems.com/){data-affiliate="1105"} can assist with this and even do new installations to fit a range of aesthetics.

## **Enhance Lighting**

You might not see [outdoor lighting](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/how-to-decorate-your-outdoor-area-with-lights/){data-affiliate="1106"} during the day, but it does contribute your curb appeal. Pathway lights, solar lights, and even unique lighting fixtures can add warmth to the home and make it look more inviting.

On top of this, motion-activated lights can be a great way to deter burglars and unwanted guests. You’re also able to get to your front door in the dark without risk of injury.

## **Consider a Fresh Coat of Paint**

A fresh coat of paint really can do wonders for a home. If you’ve been noticing that it’s looking a little dull, it’s certainly one improvement that makes a huge difference.

When choosing a color, be sure that it complements the style of the house. If you want to do something bold, [painting your front door](https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/colors/g558/front-door-color/){data-affiliate="1107"} can make a unique statement.

## **Start Landscaping**

Landscaping is one of the most critical aspects when it comes to curb appeal. Keeping your lawn trimmed and mowed can significantly impact the overall appearance of your home.

Small trees, plants, and [shrubs](https://www.countryliving.com/gardening/garden-ideas/g27104528/low-maintenance-bushes-shrubs/){data-affiliate="1108"} can add more color and life to the space. Of course, you’ll need to weed, water, and maintain your garden regularly. Otherwise, you may have to start back at square one!

## **Add Accessories**

Lastly, the final tip to finish the yard is to add accessories. A new mailbox, house numbers, or wreath on the front door creates a personal touch and ensures that it really does feel like home.

A birdbath, garden bench, potted plants, and doormat are other additions that you can consider including. Just remember not to overwhelm the space. Too many items can make the area appear cluttered – not to mention that they are harder to maintain over time.

## **Improving Curb Appeal Isn't Hard**

And that's it! Improving your home’s curb appeal doesn’t have to be such a difficult task. 

With a few updates and tackling each area one at a time, you can make the property appear more inviting and increase its value. Just remember to maintain it regularly – this way it will be aesthetically pleasing all year round.
