Few things are as satisfying as jumping into the shower or hot tub and cleaning off all the day’s stresses after a long day of work. A clean and stylish bathroom makes it much easier to relax. It gives the feel of a relaxing retreat in the comfort of your home. 

If your bathroom is messy and less than ideal, you need not fret. With a few tricks up your sleeve, you can transform the space into a spa-like personal retreat. Here are some [ways to make your bathroom](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/how-to-wash-clean-bathroom-rugs-mats/){data-affiliate="398"} feel better:

## 1. Organize the Bathroom Clutter

You may need supplies in the bathroom, but that is no reason to have them all over. The endless empty skincare, hair, and soap bottles should have no place in your bathroom. Start by tossing out things that you no longer need. You will be surprised to find plenty of expired supplies still occupying space on your shelves and countertops. Donate any products that are still okay but do not work for you. You can schedule a major declutter at the beginning of every season so that unnecessary things do not pile up and make your bathroom messy.

## 2. Add Some Refreshing Scent

Scents do a neat job transforming the vibe of any room. Incorporate a beautiful, fresh aroma in your bathroom. Opt for different scents each season to have a different atmosphere every time. You could use scented candles, hand soaps, or room spray to scent your bathroom. A nice smelling bathroom is one that you will enjoy spending every minute in it. It will feel like a spa every time you walk into the space.

You can also use an air vaporizer or diffuser to spread the scent of essential oils in your bathroom. Adding a few drops of chamomile, lemon, or lavender oil to a diffuser, and placing it in a central location in your bathroom, can be particularly effective. 

Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and tea tree oil, are also great choices. Eucalyptus oil has a refreshing and relaxing scent, while tea tree oil is known for its anti-fungal and antibacterial properties, which help in keeping your bathroom clean and fresh.

## 3. Install New Bathroom Fixtures

Consider brainstorming new design ideas for your bathroom. If you have a spacious bathroom, consult a professional to create a [built-in spa design](https://www.poolspalife.com.au/buying/all-about-spas/inground-spas){data-affiliate="399"} for a relaxing haven.

Lighting and water fixtures form a significant part of the bathroom. Upgrading to newer fixtures will give your bathroom an instant facelift. Schedule a [bathroom remodel](https://www.hedlundplumbing.com/service-areas/st-johns/){data-affiliate="400"} and have a professional install new faucets, sinks, and shower heads. Your jaw will drop at how beautiful your bathroom will look and feel. Consider replacing the light fixtures too. Refinishing the current ones should suffice If you are working on a [lean bathroom updating budget](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/update-bathroom-budget/){data-affiliate="401"}.

## 4. Get Some New Linens

No bathroom will feel good with old, funky linen. Switch things up to jumpstart your bathroom redecorations. Consider getting beautifully coloured linen that will tie-up with the rest of the decor in the space. Alternatively, you could opt for neutrals and bright white ones to make the bathroom look fresh. Remember to get a new set of handtowels to complement the linen.

## 5. Switch Out the Shower Curtain

This upgrade will give you maximum results with minimal effort. A new shower curtain can transform the space in an instant. Luckily, there are plenty of trendy options, and you are sure to find one that matches the style and aesthetic of your bathroom. Go the extra mile by replacing your boring shower curtain rings and going for something more exciting. Go for a [rubber ducky curtain](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/rubber-duck-bathroom-decor/){data-affiliate="402"} if you're looking for a pithy theme.

Consider shower doors or shower screens as an alternative to shower curtains. Shower doors come in various styles, including sliding, hinged, and frameless, and are more durable and easier to clean than shower curtains. Shower screens are typically glass panels that help to keep water in the shower area and are less extensive than shower doors. They offer a stylish and more open feel to the bathroom.

## 6. Add Beautiful Storage Pieces

Your skincare, hair, and body products need somewhere to stay. Instead of letting them clutter your space, arrange them in [beautiful storage baskets](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-storage-bins-baskets-boxes-professional-organizers.html){data-affiliate="403"}. Shop for nice-looking baskets that are easy on the eyes to disguise the clutter.

Moreover, vanity cabinets are an excellent choice for storing bathroom supplies like towels and beauty products like skin lotions and moisturizers. Strategically install a vanity cabinet in your bathroom for a convenient and out-of-the-way place to store bathroom items. Vanity cabinets come in various sizes and styles, so you can find one that fits perfectly with your bathroom décor.

## Spruce Up Your Bathroom

The tips above will help you create a calm oasis in your home. Every time you leave your bathroom, you will feel pampered and rejuvenated. What more could you need when you have a serene environment in your home that helps you unwind after hectic days?

And if you do spruce it up, make sure to [replace your wax ring correctly](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/toilet-wax-ring/){data-affiliate="404"} to keep things clean and tidy.
