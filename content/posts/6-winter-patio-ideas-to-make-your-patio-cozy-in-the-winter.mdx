It's starting to get a bit chilly out, and you're starting to spend less and less time on your patio, but you love your patio. When you [bought your new home](https://www.amandabrown.net/){data-affiliate="363"}, the patio was what you loved the most!

If you're looking to keep hanging out on your patio through the winter months, then you'll need to do some upgrades, and we've some ideas for you.

These patio upgrades will keep you warm and toasty, so you can continue enjoying all that fresh air. They range from expensive projects to quick and straightforward add-ons that will transform your outdoor living space into something you'll enjoy all year long.

**Here are 6 winter patio ideas:**

## 1. Enclose Your Patio for Winter

If you want to make your patio cozier in the winter, you can enclose it. You can do this by adding a roof, walls, or even a door. This will help keep the warmth in and the cold out. You can also use this method to create a private space for yourself and your guests.

Sure, this might seem like a major project, and it is, of course, but it's completely worth it in the end. An enclosure patio can be as complex as you'd like—anything from adding some screens for privacy and keeping the bugs out to full aluminum enclosed sunrooms.

You can look to a DIY solution if you're handy, or there are plenty of companies out there that will install prefabricated patio enclosures at a reasonable cost. Still, this is probably the most expensive upgrade to add some coziness to your patio, but definitely worth the upgrade.

## 2. Provide Some Heat for Your Patio

So now that your patio is enclosed, it's time to heat things a bit. Fortunately, you have some options.

Your first thought might be a firepit. Not a bad choice, but keep in mind if you have an enclosed patio, that may pose some problems. As long as you're well-ventilated, you can look at a [propane fire pit](http://Firepitsurplus.com){data-affiliate="364"} to keep you warm.

An electric heater is an excellent way to go if you already have power on your patio. Be sure to use a heater that's safe for outdoor use, and keep it away from any flammable materials.

If your patio is big, you might consider installing an overhead heat source such as an infrared heater. These can be gas or electric and work very well in the colder months.

You may need a different fire pit setup based on what your outdoor space looks like. Here are some [ideas](https://www.studionisho.com/blog/backyard-fire-pit-ideas){data-affiliate="3307"} for your backyard space.

Lastly, you might look at radiant or forced-air heaters using propane or kerosene. Keep in mind that a radiant heater will provide excellent heat, but it takes a while to warm things up; however, the forced-air heaters will heat the space quickly, but they're very noisy. It's a balance you'll have to consider.

## 3. Keep Your Feet Off the Floor With An Outdoor Rug

Nobody likes walking on a cold surface. [An outdoor rug](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/affordable-outdoor-rugs/){data-affiliate="365"} will not only give you something warm and soft to walk on but will give your patio an elegant look to it as well.

Outdoor rugs are different than the indoor variety as they're designed to withstand harsher elements such as rain and snow. They're usually made with acrylic or polypropylene, making them extremely durable – but not nearly as comfy as the indoor types.

However, if you've enclosed your patio, you can probably get away with laying down an indoor rug to add to the coziness.

## 4. Make Comfort a Necessity

With the foundation set, it's time to get comfortable with outdoor furniture.

To keep it simple and classy, look to add an outdoor couch or loveseat. These are a great option if you're trying to create a fabulous outdoor living space. You'll essentially have an outdoor living room if you opt for this route.

For fun and yet relaxing, lay down a beanbag chair, or you can throw up a hammock (or even a two-person hammock if you want a little more intimacy). Imagine slowly swinging in a luxurious hammock by your gas fire pit under the stars on a chilly winter night. Sound friendly and cozy?

There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to outdoor furniture:

- Make sure whatever you choose is comfortable. You don't want people to be uncomfortable when they come over to your place.

- Make sure the furniture is weather-resistant. You don't want anything to get ruined in the rain or snow.

- Think about what type of atmosphere you want to create.

Do you want it to be cozy and intimate or more open and inviting?

## 5. Add Some Outdoor Lighting to Set the Winter Mood

Everything is set in your outdoor living space to keep you warm and comfortable, but what about the ambiance? Have you considered how the atmosphere will feel in your new area? This is where lighting plays a role.

You have plenty of options when it comes to lighting. You can go with traditional lights such as porch lights or hanging lanterns. These are always a classic choice and can set the mood for your patio.

String lights are another popular option, and they come in all shapes and sizes. You can find some designed specifically for outdoor use, and they're perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere.

One of the most common lights you see on patios these days is stringed Edison lights. They look elegant and provide just enough lighting to make the space feel romantic.

Regardless of which style of light you go with, think about the mood you're trying to set on your outdoor living space.

## 6. Bring On The Entertainment

Last but not least, you'll need some entertainment. After all, you want your patio to be welcoming now that it has all of these comforts in place.

There are plenty of patio entertainment options to choose from. You can go with a classic option such as a TV to catch all of your big games on or binge-watch a season of your favorite show while cuddled up on your outdoor couch.

If you want something a little more interactive and have the space, you could go with a game table such as a pool table or ping pong table. This is an excellent option if you're going for a more fun environment.

Lastly, if you're looking for something just to set the mood and add a little ambiance, consider adding some tunes to your patio. This could be anything from a simple Bluetooth speaker to an outdoor stereo system. Music always sets the mood and makes things more festive.

Patios may be a great place to spend the winter months, but they're not always that cozy. With a few simple additions and tweaks, you can make your outdoor living space [feel like home](https://www.amandabrown.net/liberty-springs-community-development-in-nolanville/){data-affiliate="366"} in no time at all.

The idea is to create an atmosphere where people want to hang out – one with plenty of warmth and ambiance. We hope these ideas have been helpful and get you on the path to making your patio a remarkable outdoor living space – even in the winter!
