Most people focus on improving their home’s interior, where they spend most of their days. While this is true, there’s no harm in improving your exterior’s appearance. Enhancing your home’s exterior should help make your property look more modern and beautiful. It can help to improve your curb appeal, allowing your home to stand out in your neighborhood. 

Renovating your entire home’s exterior can be challenging and requires plenty of time and cost. If you’re just looking for an easy upgrade, listed below are some easy ways to spruce up your home exterior:

## Update Your Exterior Finish

The most prominent part of your home you can update is your exterior’s finish. You can choose to repaint or use a different finish, such as using bricks or cladding. However, since this will affect your home’s appearance, it’ll be nice if you could get a sample first. Use this to determine whether this will match and enhance your home’s exterior. To be safe, you can use a tool to visualize what your home would look like as you [choose your exterior finish](https://rockcote.com.au/systems-tool){data-affiliate="825"}. 

You can try to DIY the project if you’re repainting your exterior wall. However, if your home has more than one floor, you need to hire a professional to guarantee safety. If you’re looking to refinish your walls, a professional’s help is non-negotiable. 

## **Replace Or Repaint Your Door**

The heart of your home’s exteriors would be your front door. Updating its appearance can help to spruce up your exterior and give it a fresher look. To make things easy and affordable, you can repaint your front door with a different color. You can use something more muted or bold color to give your home character. Alternatively, you can always replace your entire door and give yourself a brand-new design. You can use a modern look with a sleek matte finish or a statement door. 

## **Surround With Outdoor Lights**

Your home shouldn’t just be beautiful during the day, but at night as well. Adding enough outdoor lights to your home will help make it well-illuminated. This should help emphasize your home’s beauty and prevent it from looking too dark. You can place wall lights, downlights, spotlights, or even string lights by the patio. 

Besides illuminating the dark, beautiful light fixtures can help add character to your home. You can choose a decorative lantern, garden lights, bollard lights, or anything that makes your home look illuminated yet beautiful. 

## **Add Patio Furniture**

If you have an empty [patio](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/building-the-perfect-patio-for-outdoor-living/){data-affiliate="826"}, this is the perfect opportunity to turn it into something functional. Adding patio furniture will help improve your home’s appearance while extending your living space. You can add a sofa or lounge chairs with an end or coffee table in the middle. You can even add a swing set to make it look more inviting. Ensure that you purchase patio furniture that’ll survive well with your environment’s weather and temperature. 

## **Include Potted Plants**

An easy and attractive way to spruce up your home’s exterior is by adding potted plants by the porch or the side of your wall. You can add potted plants on your patio or by the window to maximize your property’s vertical space. Adding plants to your home helps to make it look more vibrant and homier as you add a touch of nature to it. You can even use colored pots to give it more character. 

## **Enhance Your Yard**

Your yard’s appearance greatly impacts how your entire property would look like. Even if you have a beautiful home, if your yard looks neglected, it might bring your whole curb appeal down. With that, you also need to give importance to your [yard’s appearance](https://www.thespruce.com/backyard-landscaping-ideas-4172952){data-affiliate="827"}.

You can begin by regularly mowing your yard. You can also hire a gardener to maintain your yard for you. To put your yard’s appearance to the next level, you can hire a landscaper to help maximize its features and give it a brand-new look.

## **Give Your Driveway A Makeover**

While often neglected, your driveway’s appearance can greatly impact your entire property’s curb appeal. If your driveway still uses the same gravel from decades ago, you might want to switch it to something cleaner and safer. You can use concrete, bricks, asphalt, or paving stones. While this can’t be done on a DIY project, it’s a great way to improve your property’s appearance and the longevity of your driveway.

**Takeaway**

Sprucing up your home’s exterior is now possible with seven easy steps. You can DIY many projects, allowing a quick weekend makeover. However, there are some things that you’ll need to call for a professional. While they might be an added cost, they can guarantee an amazing result, leaving your home looking fantastic for years to come.
