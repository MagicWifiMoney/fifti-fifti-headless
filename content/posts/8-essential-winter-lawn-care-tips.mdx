Lawn care is a year-round job. While many people fail to do proper lawn care in the wintertime, you need to stand out from the pack in terms of lawn care efforts if you want a truly healthy, beautiful lawn year-round. To help you achieve this goal, here are eight essential winter lawn care tips to assist you: 

# 1. Weeding

Firstly, you’ll want to ensure you’re watching out for any harmful wintertime weeds that are appearing on your lawn. While weeds are not nearly as excessive during the wintertime, they are still a potential threat to your lawn’s health. By putting in some weeding work and maintenance every few weeks, you can prevent wintertime weeds from harming your beautiful lawn. 

# 2. Mowing

Some people wrongly assume that you should not, and can not, mow in the wintertime. However, this could not be further from the truth. It is true, however, that you need to mow less frequently during the winter months, especially if you live in a harsh climate. Knowing how to cut your grass properly in the wintertime is more complex, so [hiring a quality lawn care service](https://pureturfllc.com){data-affiliate="702"} to take care of the task is highly recommended. 

# 3. Watering

Watering is an essential year-round task if you want to keep your lawn healthy. That being said, the task is much trickier in the wintertime. You’ll want to use the proper water temperature, and amount, or otherwise you’ll risk causing freezing issues. Finding the proper balance between all the watering elements you’ll be dealing with can take a long time to perfect, but the end results are worth it and will help your lawn shine throughout the winter season. After all, a well-maintained lawn can [significantly increase your home’s value](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/8-simple-tips-to-increase-the-value-of-your-home/){data-affiliate="703"} over time. 

# 4. Aerating

The soil underneath your lawn tends to get hyper-compacted over time. The pressure from mowing, waking, and other activities causes this to occur, and if untreated, an over-compacted lawn can become damaged over time. Due to this, it’s important to aerate your lawn every few months to ensure it’s in solid condition. Doing so is especially important during the winter season, as this is when weak or over-compacted soil can do the most damage to your lawn’s foundation. 

# 5. Raking

Even after fall has passed, the winter months remain filled with falling leaves and other debris that can cover your lawn. To ensure that dying leaves and debris do not negatively impact the beauty and health of your lawn, it’s important to rake every few weeks. As you rake, you’ll have the ability to spot any other hazardous threats to your lawn as well, which will give you ample time to take care of them before they become a huge problem. 

# 6. Fertilizing 

As long as you’re not in an extra-cold climate where your ground is practically frozen, winter is the ideal time to update and replace your lawn’s fertilizer setup. You can sweeten the acidic soil with a little time on your hands, and perfect your soil’s pH balance using tools and soil tests as well. Slow-release fertilizer is especially recommended for wintertime lawn maintenance, as it will work more effectively than your traditional fertilizer in the harsher wintertime air. 

# 7. Seeding

If you’re looking to revitalize your lawn, or if you want to spice it up, you’ll need to plant the right material. Seeding is an art form, so you need to give it enough attention to ensure the seeds you’re planting thrive. It’s always better to overseed, as opposed to being stingy, as this will ensure the lawn sprouts in the way you’re intending it to. Depending on what you are planting, and what climate you live in, winter may be the best time to perform seeding tasks. 

# 8. Maintenance 

General maintenance is key to [keeping your lawn healthy](https://nbc16.com/features/in-the-garden/gallery/grass-always-greener-lawn-care-tips?photo=1){data-affiliate="704"} and well taken care of. Making sure that you maintain the work you’ve done with all of the other tips on this list is essential. Additionally, you’ll want to check on your lawn care equipment and make sure that it’s in proper working condition as well. If you use poorly maintained lawn equipment during the winter, it has a high risk of completely malfunctioning, which can lead to expensive repair costs. 

## Stay Warm During Your Wintertime Lawn Care

As you apply these eight tips to your wintertime lawn care routine, you need to ensure that you’re staying as warm as possible. If you fail to do so, you could put yourself at serious risk of hypothermia and other serious ailments. While keeping your lawn healthy is key, you need to give extra consideration to your physical health.
