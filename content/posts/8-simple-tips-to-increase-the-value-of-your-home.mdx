Your home's value is never static. It rises as you invest in its renovation and maintenance, but falls when you neglect it. Through consistent yard care, kitchen and bathroom upgrades, and reduction of energy consumption, you can boost the perceived value of your home. If you plan to sell your home soon, the following ideas will help you get a high offer on your property.

## **Add a Fresh Coat of Paint**

Updating the exterior finishes on your property will have an instant impact on any potential buyer. Depending on the size of your home, you can take this up as a DIY project. 

The return on investing in a new coat of paint can be as high as a 5 percent increase in value. Apart from the ROI, your home will look renewed and make you feel more relaxed. 

## **Renovate Your Yard**

Without excessive effort, your yard can have an irresistible visual appeal. A well-taken care of yard and garden can significantly increase the [value of your property](https://www.offshore-bpo.com/){data-affiliate="505"} and attract potential buyers. Additionally, you can invest a bit more time into [transforming your outdoor areas](https://www.jimsmowing.com.au/2022/04/10-simple-side-yard-ideas-to-revamp-your-outdoor-areas/){data-affiliate="506"} into a serene and safe space to spend time outside. Also, there are plenty of other things you can do to improve the look and atmosphere in your garden, front or back yard, such as

- Prune trees, shrubs, and bushes
- Trim your lawn
- Plant colorful flowers
- Create pathways with painted stones
- Add low-maintenance trees
- Install a water feature or fountain
- Create a sitting area with wooden seats.

## **Work on Your Front Door**

Front doors create strong impressions on visitors' minds. A door with streaks, faded paint, or a worn handle will reduce your home's curb appeal.

You don't need to replace your front door to make it attractive. Give it a fresh look by painting it, changing the door handle, and keeping it clean.

You may even make your door a focal point. Draw attention to it by coating it with contrasting glossy paint. Then arrange some beautiful potted plants near it. 

Another door you shouldn't neglect is your garage door. Repairing or replacing it can give close to a 90% return. Remember it is one of the first things potential buyers will see. You can [install a modern garage door](https://www.lushome.com/how-to-choose-modern-garage-doors-improve-curb-appeal/240712){data-affiliate="507"} with a glass panel or opt for a remote-controlled door.

## **Renovate Your Kitchen**

Kitchen renovations offer one of the highest rates of return on your investment. Depending on the upgrades, it is possible to have up to 80% return on low-cost renovations. That's why experts say: "if you make the exterior look great, then focus on your kitchen and bathroom." 

However, you don't need to go overboard to make your kitchen look enchanting. Here are some practical suggestions:

- Repaint the walls and cabinets
- Change cabinet doors or turn them into open shelves
- Replace your faucet with a higher quality shiny one
- Replace outdated appliances like microwave ovens and refrigerators.

## **Spruce Up Your Bathroom**

After your kitchen, the next place to renovate is your bathroom. Just like your kitchen, investing in a bathroom remodel is quite profitable.

Start with low-cost modifications. Replace taps, door handles, and towel racks with shiny new models. If you have the budget, consider replacing tiles and lighting fixtures.

To conserve water and make your home more eco-friendly, upgrade your water closet and shower to low-flow models. They can save close to 50% of the water used by traditional models.

## **Add More Insulation**

Poor insulation can account for up to 30% of energy loss in homes. Most of these energy losses take place around doors, windows, and the attic.

Without spending a lot of money, you can improve the insulation in your home. Sealing leaky door and window spaces will conserve energy and reduce your utility bills in summer and winter.

Identify leaky spots and seal them with weather-stripping, and caulk. Then test the sealing and reinforce it with a final one.

## **Increase Energy Efficiency**

Don't ignore energy-saving upgrades if you want to raise your property's value. You will enjoy lower utility bills and entice buyers with the promise of lower home maintenance costs.

To obtain the highest energy savings consider:

- Replacing old appliances with [Energy-star certified models](https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/){data-affiliate="508"}
- Controlling your HVAC with a smart thermostat
- Upgrading old windows to double-gazed models
- Installing solar water heaters

## **Lower Home Maintenance Costs**

Smart home buyers will opt for a home that doesn't need constant maintenance. For instance, if a water heater needs replacement or a furnace is out of service, it will put most buyers off.

So, go around your home and list all the appliances, fixtures, fittings, and components that need repair. Then make a schedule to repair them to boost your home's resale price.

Additionally, you can replace building components with low-maintenance alternatives. A good example is swapping your wood siding with a more attractive vinyl siding.

Now you have many practical ideas to raise your home's value. You know you can recoat your building, renew your outdoor aesthetics, renovate your kitchen and bathroom, or improve energy efficiency. Take the next step and make a plan to apply these ideas over the next few weeks.
