The colours you choose for your home can have a big impact on how it looks and feels. Neutral tones such as beige, white, and grey are always a safe pick because they lend a conventional and timeless feel to the space. A splash of colour can also lend a sense of elegance; just be careful not to overdo it. 

## 2. **Improve Your Flooring**

Adding some stone flooring from [Quorn Stone](https://www.mystonefloor.com/){data-affiliate="911"} in cream or light grey to any decor will lend a refined touch, not only because of the material (from limestone to stone) but also because of the colour. So consider the flooring's material, design, and colour to make your home as classy as possible. 

## 3. **Lighting**

When it comes to establishing a stylish ambience in your home, lighting is crucial. Consider investing in some eye-catching lighting, such as a chandelier or a one-of-a-kind floor lamp. 

Dimmer switches are also useful since they allow you to change the ambiance of the room. If you have a fireplace, turning it on during the winter months can make it feel cosy and inviting.

Antiques can quickly [bring character and charm to your home](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/decorating-with-vintage){data-affiliate="912"}. Search for one-of-a-kind items like vintage mirrors, brass candlesticks, or a classic grandfather clock. Vintage furniture can also be a terrific addition; just make sure it matches the rest of your home's decor.

## 5. **Improve Your Furnishings**

Investing in high-quality furniture may instantly elevate the look of your home. Avoid anything too trendy or flamboyant, and instead look for pieces with clean lines and neutral hues. Leather furniture is a classic choice that can add a touch of elegance to any living room.

## 6. **Include Some Art**

Art can bring color and texture to any area, and it's a terrific way to express yourself. Search for things that speak to you and suit your home's overall look.

## 7. **Add Some Greenery**

Plants may instantly improve the aesthetic of your living area. Search for low-maintenance plants like succulents or snake plants and consider putting them in unique pots or containers. A trailing plant, such as English Ivy, can also be hung from a bookshelf or ceiling to lend a touch of beauty.

## 8. **Accessorize**

Accessories are an excellent way to add personality and style to your home. Look for standout pieces like a beautiful vase or a one-of-a-kind throw pillow. A marble cheese board in your kitchen or some slate coasters on your coffee table might offer a sense of elegance.
