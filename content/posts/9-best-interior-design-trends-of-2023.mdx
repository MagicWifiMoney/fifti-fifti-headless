As 2023 draws to a close, we reflect on some of the biggest trends to hit the interior decor scene. From the practicality of smart homes and multifunctional pieces to the eco-friendly movement and a resurgence in upcycling, they all made a big impact. Here’s a look back at the 9 best interior design trends of 2023.

## Multifunctional Furniture

Multifunctional furniture, like the [multifunctional dining table](https://transformertable.com/pages/extendable-dining-tables-and-sets){data-affiliate="1460"} and modular sofa with storage compartments, continued to be popular. As people strive to make their homes more functional with less investment, this is a trend that is set to continue. 

Multifunctional furniture allows multiple possibilities no matter your available space. A multipurpose table can be used as a home office space, a homework nook for the kids, or a place for arts and crafts. And, of course, a dining area, when family and friends pop around for a meal. Extend the table and you’re all set.

This answered the needs of homeowners dealing with remote work and online school. But it has become just as useful in the office environment, where extendable tables can accommodate both small team discussions and larger staff meetings. 

## Bold and Beautiful — Bright Hues & Prints

Forget those boring neutrals and all-white spaces. While some minimalist die-hards clung to these spartan palettes, minimalism slowly gave way to maximalism. All things bold and beautiful were celebrated, from bright hues and prints to exciting textures. 

This can be seen in the Pantone color choice for the year, Viva Magenta, and designers’ love affair with colors like raspberry, blood orange, and even gorgeous blues like turquoise. Earth tones were also the flavor of the day, possibly because of the boho influences in fashion.

## A Focus on Wellbeing 

A focus on well-being had us looking for creative ways to bring serenity into the residential space. Residential meditation rooms and backyard retreats were the order of the day. More people looked to their homes not just as a place to eat and sleep, but also to restore their mental and emotional health.  

This gave rise to the need for personal zen-like inner sanctums in the domestic arena. Bedrooms became more than just places of rest, they were given the retreat treatment. Bathrooms sometimes looked more like private spas. [Comfortable surroundings](https://fifti-fifti.net/guides/home-renovations-for-next-level-comfort/){data-affiliate="1461"} and natural materials were key elements.

## Vintage Reimagined — A Touch of 70s Nostalgia

Suddenly those low, curved silhouettes in psychedelic colors and funky prints from the 70s, looked cool again. Vintage style icons were reimagined, and we were hit hard with a touch of nostalgia. But this time around, there was a bit more order to the colorful chaos. 

Dark wood, rattan, cane, and bamboo were once again center stage. Even macrame made its way back, along with other vintage crafts. Wavy 70s-inspired wallpaper made a brief comeback, too, and it wasn’t just used for walls! Beanbags and poufs graced [living rooms](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/living-room-design-help/){data-affiliate="1462"} all over, for a touch of boho bliss.

## Natural Materials & Energies

Natural materials and energies were* in*, in a big way! Perhaps we had the growing eco-friendly movement to thank for that. Or maybe it was also due to the love of all things natural which reemerged with our nostalgic moments. Whatever the reason, natural fibers, and energies were a big 2023 trend.

Wood and stone were favored materials again, plastics were out. Let’s not forget those wicker items. From chairs to baskets, they were seen in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and even bathrooms, everywhere.

While natural energy like solar power is having its time in the sun, other [sustainable features](https://fifti-fifti.net/guides/sustainable-features-to-look-for-in-a-new-home/){data-affiliate="1463"} have made their way into interiors. Low-flow bathroom and kitchen fixtures and energy-efficient HVAC systems were in high demand in 2023 and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. 

## Function Meets Fashion — Appliances as Decor

Function met fashion, with appliances increasingly being treated as part of the decor. No longer satisfied with the uninspired all-white appliances of the past, consumers demanded color and style in their kitchens. And appliance manufacturers heeded the call. 

It was not unusual to see pops of pastel and even primary colors, amid the white, black, silver, and bronze. Retro-styled or decorative kitchen appliances appeared on everyone’s wishlists. The kitchen became a place to entertain again, and even humble kettles and toasters now had high style.

## Smart Homes

With the advent of the Internet of Things, Smart Homes were no longer science fiction, they became science fact. In 2023, it became clear this trend is here to stay. But unlike the futuristic homes envisaged for these times in years gone by, today’s Smart Homes are a mix of science and *fashion*. 

With convenient remotely controlled lights, HVAC, and even appliances, this trend for the [Smart and sustainable home](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/11/23/smart-from-the-start-smart-home-is-becoming-sustainable-home/){data-affiliate="1464"} is becoming the norm.  As the Internet of Things becomes more commonplace, and sustainability becomes ever more important, we see this trend growing. 

In time, it will extend its reach into even more areas of residential and commercial design. That’s a trend we are happy to support!

## Old Meets New — Upcycling and Repurposing

Upcycling and repurposing were no longer the sole domain of the budget-conscious consumer or the environmentalists among us. The internet has exploded in the last year with upcycling projects, and thus recycling, reusing, and repurposing have earned their street credentials.

As a result, interior stylists have sought ways to bring repurposed items and even reclaimed wood and other materials into homes and offices. This is good news for the environment, and we’re happy to see this trend stay into 2024 and beyond.

## Versatile Spaces

Thanks in part to the lockdowns necessitated by the 2020-2021 pandemic, people worldwide had to adjust to working from home. The need for creating ‘home offices’ in a hurry, led to a new trend for versatile spaces. 

As many declined to return to the conventional office environment afterward, this continued into 2022 and 2023. Versatile spaces are now one of the most sought-after aspects of residential interiors. But it has progressed from a need for home office space to a need for multipurpose rooms, with various zones.

This has been felt in the commercial sector too. Employers, eager to offer a better work/life balance, throw conventional office decor ideas out the window. Workspaces have moved away from the traditional, to a more inviting and ergonomic design.
