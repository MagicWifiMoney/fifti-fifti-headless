Mulch products not only help your garden thrive but help ensure that it looks stunning as well. If you want your garden to wow people, you need to choose a mulch product that will complement the plants in your garden (while keeping them as healthy as possible simultaneously). Home gardeners can get extra experimental, as they need much less mulch to keep their gardens thriving. For those wondering what mulch they should invest in, here are nine mulch products that are perfect for keeping your landscape beautiful: 

# 1. Wood Chips

Wood chips are incredibly popular amongst all gardeners. Unsold trees are often ground into wood chips with the express purpose of being sold as mulch, after all. You can get wood chips in a wide variety of colors and thicknesses, making them perfect for gardeners who want to add their own aesthetic touch to their gardens as they ensure they remain healthy. Many people ask themselves “[where can I find mulch near me](https://www.zimmermanmulch.com/mulch/cornwall-pa/){data-affiliate="699"}?” And if you find yourself asking this, you need to invest in wood chip-based mulch. 

# 2. Cocoa Chips

Also known as cocoa hull mulch, this unique type of mulch is made from the main ingredient of chocolate. The hull of the cocoa bean is useless in terms of cooking, so it’s used to make other useful products, such as mulch, instead. The fact that it retains that beautiful chocolate coloring has made the mulch product incredibly popular amongst gardeners who focus on beauty above all else. 

# 3. Composted Animal Manure

Many different types of compost products are used for mulch. However, composted animal manure is one of the best compost-centric mulch products you can invest in. Not only does it provide your garden with natural ingredients, but it actually improves the quality of your soil as it degrades as well. There are many different colors available for this product as well, depending on where you buy it. 

# 4. Crusher Dust

Crusher dust is made up of different stones, gravel, rubber, and more. This inorganic mulch product is widely used in commercial gardens, thanks to its versatility. Because so many other products use the same ingredients as crusher dust, this type of mulch is great for gardeners on a budget as well. If you find the right look, you can even make crusher dust appear stunning in the right setting. 

# 5. Landscape Plastic 

Although not the most beautiful mulch product out there, landscape plastic is phenomenal for hyper charging your gardening efforts (especially if you have limited time for gardening activities). The plastic is spread tightly over your soil and allows both heat and moisture to flow down into the soil more effectively, creating a better growing environment for your plants as a result. 

# 6. Rubber Mulch 

While it may sound weird at first, rubber mulch is actually incredibly interesting. For gardens that are full of succulents and other plants that need little to no water, rubber mulching is absolutely perfect. You not only do not need to replace it for incredibly long periods, but the product also has a hyper-modern look that many homeowners love. Especially in the southwest, rubber mulch has become extremely popular. 

# 7. Newspaper 

Another popular type of compost-based mulch, using newspaper as mulch is one of the best ways you can recycle your daily news. For people who are [taking care of small, more intimate gardens](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/gardening-ideas-for-beginners){data-affiliate="700"}, newspapers can be used to save you money and provide your garden with a highly unique aesthetic. Just make sure you do not forget to replace the newspaper once it begins to become degraded. 

# 8. Shredded Leaves 

Shredded leaves are incredibly popular among gardeners who live out in the country. If you don’t mind gathering up leaves that have fallen during the fall season, you can make your garden look absolutely stunning for no cost at all. The natural nutrients the shredded leaves produce for your garden’s plants make the product that much more appealing. 

# 9. Straw 

Similar to shredded leaves, straw is easy to come by if you live out in the country. While it’s not as cheap as shredded leaves, straw has a natural beauty to it that [many home gardeners crave](https://fifti-fifti.net/landscaping/first-time-gardening-tips-pros-and-cons-of-diy-landscaping/){data-affiliate="701"}. If you live on a farm, you can always use your spare straw to help your garden’s plants thrive. 

## Unlock Your Garden’s Full Potential

With the right mulch product, you can easily unlock your garden’s full potential. Each of these nine stellar mulch products comes with its own aesthetic advantages. Additionally, each of them can unlock different nutritional and growth benefits for your garden’s plants (so choose wisely)! Your garden’s future depends on you making the right decision next time you go to buy mulch products, after all.
