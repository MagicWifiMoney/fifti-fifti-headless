Many regard pleasing aesthetics as the essential component of any interior design. But there are others who feel comfort should be the utmost priority in our homes — that it should be a haven into which we can escape from the stress of the outside world.

Given these two takes, it can be difficult for some to find a balance between comfort and style when designing their interior. Indeed, some decor items are functional and comforting but rather plain. And others are eye-catching but offer no real comfort or any other function.

Nevertheless, improving comfort and style is something you can achieve simultaneously in your space.

Fortunately, you're right where the juice is! Here, we explain steps to take when investing in comfort and style for your interior.

## **A Transitional Style May Be Your Best Bet**

The traditional style focuses on using rich, dark colors, floral patterns, and several details around the room — a maximalist approach. Modern style is minimalistic, using neutral colors and clean design lines. While traditional may feel overly decorated but loud (not so comfy), modern looks overly comfy but not very stylish.

[The transitional style](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/transitional-style-101){data-affiliate="453"} is the bridge between modern and traditional styles. It's a middle ground, helping you find the right balance between comfort and style.

When using this style, focus on using clean, straight lines from the hanging lights down to the [coffee table](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/decorate-round-coffee-table/){data-affiliate="454"} and warm neutrals like chocolate browns. Add some richness to the space by incorporating statement pieces here and there.

## **Choose Comfort Over Style Where it Matters**

In a perfect world, one shouldn't have to forego comfort when shopping for style or vice versa. In short, some elements exude style and comfort at the same time, such as the [smart window air conditioner](https://windmillair.com/product/the-windmill-ac/){data-affiliate="455"} that's quiet, eco-friendly, and visually appealing. However, not every essential home item can offer both style and comfort simultaneously. In such cases, comfort should win.

For example, think about a couch. What good is an incredibly beautiful and [luxurious couch](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/best-couch-covers-pets/){data-affiliate="456"} if you can't lie comfortably in it for 10 minutes?

Make comfort a priority in certain areas where its absence can severely impact how homely your space *feels* rather than *looks*. Such areas include furniture and flooring that's great on the feet. These things tend to be more expensive and durable, so you want to ensure you spend on something you would love to keep around for a long time.

## **Incorporate Style with Visual Elements**

Style and aesthetics can be the priority for other elements like [lighting](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/living-room-lighting/){data-affiliate="457"}, wallpapers, coffee tables, gadgets, and [stylish plants](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/arrange-plants-living-room/){data-affiliate="458"}.

Choosing the best indoor plants depends on light conditions, space availability, and personal preferences. Some popular indoor plants known for adaptability include the snake plant, spider plant, and peace lily. Snake plants are hardy and tolerate low light, while spider plants are easy to grow and produce pups for propagation. Boston ferns, with their feathery fronds, prefer high humidity and indirect light.

Peace lilies are appreciated for their elegant flowers and air-purifying qualities. ZZ plants, pothos, and rubber plants are other low-maintenance options, each with unique features. On the other hand, the fiddle leaf fig is favored for its large leaves, and aloe vera is known for both its gel and ability to thrive in dry conditions. When selecting indoor plants, consider the specific lighting conditions, watering needs, and available space for optimal growth. 

Additionally, you can incorporate style into your living space by upgrading your furniture. For instance, you can replace old, malfunctioning pieces with new, modern, stylish pieces. Elegant, rustic, and vintage themes are also available, especially if you buy them online. Just choose a reputable [furniture store](https://www.dreamo.com.au/){data-affiliate="459"} offering unique chairs, sofas, tables, and cabinets.

You can incorporate other visual elements in your living room. All you need is to stimulate your creative imagination.   

To do this, take a step back and view your interior from the doorway. What gaps do you think need to be filled? What can you touch up with some wall art or accent lights?

Aim for [focal areas](https://www.thespruce.com/creating-and-defining-a-focal-point-452316){data-affiliate="460"} that will quickly grab attention. And when buying stylish decor items for these spots, remember that trends come and go, so you shouldn't go for the overly pricy ones. Why, you may need a home makeover within a year, and throw all of those items out!

Finally, go for what you love. Remember that decoration is subjective, and what looks stylish or comfortable to one person may not be so for everyone else. So go for what makes the most sense to you. It's your home, and if you're proud of and comfortable in it, that's all that truly matters.
