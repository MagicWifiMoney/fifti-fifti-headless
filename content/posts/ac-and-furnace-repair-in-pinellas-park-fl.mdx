Many people, especially "snowbirds," flock to the South, like areas of Florida, to escape the frigid temperatures from the country's northern regions. While it stays mild in Pinellas Park throughout the season, it's not without its cold spells. 

That means residents still need to take preventive measures to maintain comfort and efficiency with their HVAC equipment. Reaching out to a trusted, qualified company like [Gulf Coast Heating & AC](https://gulfcoastacservices.com){data-affiliate="1798"} for servicing and regular maintenance consistently will keep it functioning at peak performance in any weather conditions. 

Gulf Coast Heating & AC

6331 39th St North #100, Pinellas Park, FL 33781

Whether a snowbird or a native Floridian, the suggestion is to have a tune-up in the fall before the cooler temperatures set in and then again in the spring before the extreme heat of the summer begins. 

The HVAC repair and maintenance contractor will inspect for signs of early deterioration and any potential defects or damage and make recommendations for repairs. These are made before they have a chance to turn into critical issues, which can result in more expensive repairs. 

## How To Prepare Your HVAC For Winter in the South 

Winter in the South might be milder than the rest of the country, but even Florida has the potential for cold snaps. Residents and snowbirds traveling to the state for the season must prepare to begin in the fall. Part of that prep involves [winterizing the HVAC system](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/winter-care-tips-your-florida-ac-system-ensuring-comfort-kelly-sparks-febye?){data-affiliate="1799"}.

Reaching out to a reputable, reliable repair and maintenance contractor twice each year for inspection and a tune-up will ensure optimum efficiency and comfort regardless of the weather conditions. 

These technicians will assess for early signs of deterioration or potential defects and make recommendations for corrections before there's a chance for worsening problems and more expensive repairs. Here are a few helpful tips to get the air conditioning prepped for winter and prepare the heating system. 

### Preparing the central air conditioning for winter 

Florida temperatures remain mild throughout the winter but are cool enough that the air conditioning can get a break. [Go here](https://comfortcontrolspecialists.medium.com/the-hottest-tips-to-keep-your-cool-summer-ac-maintenance-315da2d05339){data-affiliate="1800"} for summer heat maintenance tips. That means, though, that residents need to have the system serviced and protected for the season. Here are a few steps to follow for winterizing your unit. 

- **Shut down: **Go to the primary circuit breaker, where you will switch the power to the unit to the "off" position. Only do this when you're prepared to go without the unit for the remainder of the season. 

- **Clean the unit: **With a hose or a damp cloth, wash down the exterior unit of all the dirt and grime that accumulated over the summer. When using a hose, make sure to use a gentle glow. 

- **Debris: **Any debris surrounding or covering the unit should be removed or cleared away. Cut back grass, foliage, and plantings to a clearance of at least 2 ft. Anything blocking the system can create an environment for mold or mildew to grow. Keeping it free from debris will protect the unit. Check out these [air conditioning tips](https://www.myfloridahomeenergy.com/help/library/hvac/air-conditioning/#sthash.Y7iXENWT.dpbs){data-affiliate="1801"} for more help. 

### Preparing your heating system for the season 

Some people avoid using cooling or heating in Florida, but there can be cold snaps where some heat can make the home much more comfortable. Preparing the system and having the heating serviced is important to ensure optimum efficiency. Here are a few steps to follow. 

**Schedule maintenance:  **

When preparing for winter, a priority is to schedule a preventive inspection and regular maintenance tune-up for the heating system. The HVAC professional will test the unit, clean the system, and check for possible defects, deterioration, or damage that needs repairs or replacement. 

It is recommended that this service be performed twice each year but at least once each fall for optimum efficiency of the equipment. The objective is to catch issues early before they become major problems and costly repairs. 

This way, your heating will run seamlessly, [keeping you warm](https://fifti-fifti.net/utilities/winter-hvac-prep-keeping-warm-without-breaking-your-bank/){data-affiliate="1802"} and comfortable with no hassles until spring. 

### Air filters should be replaced 

When air filters are neglected, these can affect the household air quality plus impact the system's airflow. This makes the HVAC work harder, putting a strain on the equipment, which can ultimately shorten the unit's lifespan. The air filter should be changed roughly every 90 days. 

If you have pets or are exposed to more allergens or dust, changing it more frequently, as often as every 30 days, is suggested. This will help provide better air quality and maintain better airflow since most people will be spending more time indoors. This is especially critical if you have anyone with preexisting respiratory conditions. 

### Thermostat testing 

Before the heater can be turned on, the thermostat functions need to be tested to ensure these are working adequately. When the thermostat doesn't align with the heating system, it can be damaging to the unit. The connections and settings need to be accurate. 

A recommendation by most HVAC professionals is to upgrade to a programmable thermostat. These not only encourage [energy efficiency](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/10-great-high-roi-energy-efficient-home-improvements/){data-affiliate="1803"}, but they make it straightforward and simple. The programmable thermostat aligns perfectly with the heating system, ensuring optimum functionality and an aligned system. 

When your system is becoming aged, fall is the ideal season to consider a replacement before the freezing weather kicks in. It will be up and running with any quirks or flaws worked out before the winter season starts. 

The priority is ensuring you're prepared in case of a cold snap because regardless of being in the South, you can experience a bitterly cold period now and again that you might not expect. It's wise to be prepared for any situation. Do you [need AC](https://gatorrated.com/blog/no-ac-emergency-florida){data-affiliate="1804"}?
