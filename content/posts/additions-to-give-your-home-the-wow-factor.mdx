There are so many different ideas and ways to turn your home into a dream home and really give it the wow factors that you might feel a little overwhelmed with all the choices. Don’t worry; it’s a good thing, really, because when you have more choice, you’ll have the chance to make your home exactly how you want it; you just need a little guidance to help you narrow things down. With that in mind, here are some additions to give your home the wow factor; see what you think about these as a place to start. 

## **Have a home sauna **

Having a home sauna is a fantastic way to really give your home the wow factor, but in a way that’s going to be useful for you, too – the last thing you want is to have an impressive home that you can’t really make the most of and use like you want to because although it looks good, it’s not particularly [functional](https://www.houzz.com/magazine/10-keys-to-a-well-functioning-house-stsetivw-vs~90183191){data-affiliate="1326"}. 

[Home saunas](https://www.sunstreamsaunas.co.uk/){data-affiliate="1327"} by Sun Stream Saunas UK can be customized to fit any space you might have, so you definitely don’t need a mansion to have one. Plus, you can make it look however you want, and even go for a clever infrared sauna if you want to. There’s so much choice, and once you have a home sauna and you know you can go there to unwind when you need to, your home and your life will have the wow factor, for sure. 

## **Home cinema **

Turning a spare room in your home into a [home cinema](https://www.realhomes.com/advice/how-to-build-a-home-cinema-room){data-affiliate="1328"} is something else that you’ll love to use yourself but that you’ll find people are impressed by when they see it – that’s what the wow factor is all about. With the right audio-visual setup, you can have the real cinematic experience in a garage, attic, basement, or even spare bedroom. Remember, your home cinema doesn’t have to be big, but if you do only have a small space, you’ll need to make sure the equipment you buy doesn’t overwhelm it, or it won’t be comfortable to watch any movies there. 

At the very least, you’ll need a high-quality flatscreen TV, but if you can fit it in, a screen and projector are much more authentic. Then you’ll also need some excellent surround sound speakers, and they’ll need to be set up in the right way so you get the full benefit of them. There are experts who can do that for you, so it might be best to hire someone to ensure you do it right. 

## **Wine cellar **

If you ask a group of people, not many of them are going to have a [wine cellar in their home](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/unlock-the-secrets-to-designing-your-dream-home-wine-cellar/){data-affiliate="1329"}, so if you want to include the wow factor, this is certainly one way to do it – it’s different, fun, and stylish. Of course, to really enjoy a wine cellar, you’ll need to enjoy wine; otherwise, it’s going to be hard to want to add to [your collection](https://winefolly.com/tips/10-tips-for-starting-a-wine-collection/){data-affiliate="1330"}, so that’s something to bear in mind as well. 

A wine cellar isn’t the same as a regular cellar because you’ll need to make sure you keep the temperature and humidity just right; otherwise, the wine will be ruined (and if you’re using the cellar to keep rare and/or expensive wines, that would be a disaster). 

To make your wine cellar look great, you can invest in some custom-made wine racks or, if you’re feeling like a challenge, you can make them yourself – the sense of achievement you’ll get will be exciting on top of the wine collecting you’re amassing in your home.
