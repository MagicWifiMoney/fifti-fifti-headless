When injecting the home with some much-needed style, elegance, and interesting detail, mirrors are elements designers swear by and are the core design principles they rely on regardless of how many trends come and go. Even if you’re not a designer yourself, or don’t have the budget to seek professional help, you can use this not-so-secret secret to your advantage, especially in a tricky room like the bathroom.

As a utilitarian area mostly reserved for grooming necessities and physiological needs, it’s not always thought of as one with that much décor potential. Even when it is, there may be some obstacles, like a small size, to work with. And yet, nothing of this is a match for the mirror! The [fancy arched vanity mirror](https://www.highgrovebathrooms.com.au/mirrors/mirrors/arched-pencil-edge-mirrors/) is the perfect example of what this décor piece can do for the interior as a whole.

### What Can You Expect from an Arched Mirror?

With the market being abundant in options, ranging from oval to square, and everything in between, opting for the arched means you’re up for enhancing your private oasis with a distinctive charm that can elevate the aesthetics and at the same time optimize functionality. 

### The Cosy Architectural Effect

One of the reasons why the arched vanity mirror has remained a popular choice these last few years is its refined and sophisticated shape that instantly boosts the space with the right amount of fluidity. Unlike when introducing a conventional shape, like the age-old classic—the rectangular with all its angles, there’s a graceful curvature. 

This instantly fills the room with architectural softness, even when you’re working with a modern mirror design without a frame. You can further invite more of and increase this effect by adding more curved elements to get a palpable, soothing outcome. Nice examples you could use to your advantage would be curved bath/shower glass panels, curved floor mats, curved sinks, and curved hardware.

Steering away from the monotonous and uninspiring geometric shapes where all you see are angles is a strategy that’s bound to get you a warm and inviting result overflowing with harmony and symmetry. Don’t be surprised if this change in the bathroom makes you fall in love with this room more and truly come to view it as a sanctuary rather than a room mostly to do with function.

### The Timeless Appeal

The fact that the arched bathroom mirror has been trendy over the years speaks for itself – deciding to invite this particular design into your abode is a wise move as this is a design that stands the test of time. Whether you’re all up for keeping pace with trends or not, getting this soft and smooth aesthetic is something that won’t require change for years to come unless you grow out of it and opt to add some angles instead.

The beauty of this timeless aesthetic is that it offers long-term value and can fit right in, no matter what your style or preference may be. The harmonious silhouette is the perfect match for a traditional décor interior, as well as modern, eclectic, and any other you can imagine. In short, it’s a classic you can rely on time and time again. More so, there are versatile framings that you can use to emphasise more of the room’s existing style.

### The Flexibility with Versatility

These mirrors are available in a variety of design options, so whether you prefer to introduce a small-sized arch mirror, or would rather go for an arch mirror full-length one instead that makes for a statement piece, you’re sure to find the desired piece. 

Moreover, there’s versatility in terms of materials, finishes, frames with intricate detailing, and modern frameless models, making these elements great on their own as much as in a combination, perfect for other rooms too. You’re in control of where and how you choose to add this incredible detail. You have the chance to mount one above the vanity or a pair for a double vanity + double sink arrangement that makes grooming with a spouse or roommate easier and more enjoyable. 

Even if you don’t have room for a vanity, a small bathroom could still benefit from this kind of mirror added over a pedestal sink, for instance. This guarantees to make the room airier and brighter altogether by giving the illusion of space by reflecting more light (both natural and artificial). As you come to love the cozy aesthetic, you may as well use it in more rooms of your home to spread the coziness and warmth. 

An arch mirror large in size is just the piece to be added over the console in the hallway to make for a pleasant entrance, as it is in the bedroom above the nightstand, the living room above the fireplace, the guest room right on the statement wall, and even the washroom. If you’re up for adding some elegant vibe to the study or home office too, it’s just as great to add above a desk to invite more light into the workspace.

### The Elegant Functionality

Yes, it’s possible to have the best of both functionality and aesthetics, and this is exactly what you can get with modern arched vanity mirrors. Not only are they things to behold, and things to marvel at with their charm and detailing (depending on whether you have something ornate or simple and minimalist), but they also offer a lot in terms of functionality. 

Besides boosting your bathroom's [timeless aesthetic](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/bathroom-design-trends-that-are-hot-right-now/){data-affiliate="3521"}, these are elements that can significantly improve your prep routine first thing in the morning, as you don’t have to deal with unnecessary cleaning chores thanks to the advanced properties such as the anti-fingerprint coating. Of course, this doesn’t mean you won’t have to do your bit of the maintenance that has its role in preserving the beauty and functionality of the piece, but it certainly reduces the need to do the chore often. 

Look for mirrors that have low-maintenance and easy-to-clean surfaces, like those modern designs with quality glass, and you can be sure of making the most of this investment. Additional aspects to look into to get more of the elegant functionality are reduced fogging, accurate reflection, and no distortion. Check that the installation is properly done to minimize the distortion risk even more, and avoid any damages. Every bit of care you invest prolongs the lifespan of this precious practical [décor](https://homeimprovementcast.co.uk/inspire-me-home-decor/){data-affiliate="3509"} component.
