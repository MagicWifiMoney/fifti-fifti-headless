Torrential rain in the UK provides a subtle signal that summer is well and truly over [and that autumn has arrived](https://www.prettylittlehome.co.uk/blog/5-easy-ways-to-transition-your-decor-from-summer-to-autumn/){data-affiliate="1208"}. To get yourself in the right mindset for the new season, it’s often a good idea to refresh your décor at home. We can take inspiration from the world of homeware and interior design – and apply the lessons we learn in many different areas of the home.

The changes we make might be subtle, with just a few accent pieces here and there being rearranged, but their effect is often unmistakable.

## Shapes and Patterns

In a departure from the minimalism that has defined interior design in recent years, 2023 has seen a marked shift toward experimentation with shapes. You can incorporate this sense of adventure into your autumnal home changes.

This means an emphasis on patterns ahead of block colours. Think about spots, stripes, and geometric designs. When it comes to any wall art, wallpaper, or hanging décor, the importance of abstract patterns is difficult to understate.

If you want to get the kids involved in your décor, then perhaps the best bet might be pressed flowers, which can function as wall art. Find the right flowers, and it’s hard to go wrong. Get it right, and you’ll get artwork with sentimental as well as aesthetic value.

## Mustard, deep reds, and blues

Certain colours naturally match with autumn. These are the cosy colours that evoke fallen leaves and nights in with a hot beverage. These colours also tend to match the most significant event of the season: Halloween. You can find [wreaths and other autumnal decorations](https://www.lights4fun.co.uk/collections/autumn-wreaths-garlands){data-affiliate="1209"} that incorporate these colours in the most natural way possible.

## Glass Pieces

The right glassware can make a big difference in creating that autumnal vibe. Here, we’re thinking not just of clear glassware (which naturally goes with everything), but with darker tinted glass, in a variety of organic shapes. Vases and lanterns can elevate your autumnal décor when you’re judicious about the way you include them. To begin with, go for a few statement pieces, and then add more.

## Statement Rug

Soft furnishings offer an amazing way to pull everything together and give your décor a sense of overall coherence. This goes especially [for a large, statement rug](https://www.homesandgardens.com/advice/how-to-choose-a-rug){data-affiliate="1210"}, which can provide a valuable textural contrast against expanses of smooth hardwood and tiled flooring – but which will often work just as well with a carpeted floor.

Large, fluffy rugs tend to emphasise the sense of cosiness and warmth we all crave during autumn. With the right rug, you’ll set the vibe, and put yourself in the mood to curl up in front of the fire, and watch a few Halloween movies while munching on seasonal snacks!
