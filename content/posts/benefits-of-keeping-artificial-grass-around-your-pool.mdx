Your pool area is the most happening place in your house, and keeping it clean is essential. The best way to ensure this is by keeping the area around your pool clean. 

As per the stats, almost 60% of houses in Toronto prefer to have gardens. However, having natural grass around your pool can be the reason for pests, mud, or debris gathering in your grass and your pool.  If you want to install grass around your pool, installing [artificial grass Toronto](https://lazylawn.ca/services/artifical-lawn-landscaping){data-affiliate="519"} is always recommended, as the weather conditions are not suitable for maintaining natural grass. 

There are many benefits when installing artificial grass in your house and your pool area. Some of them are as follows:

## Keeps Pests Away from Your Pool

The compound annual growth rate(CAGR), as announced by the market supplier of artificial grass in Toronto, will reach 8.7% by 2026. 

Installing artificial grass around your pool area will keep pests and debris away from your pool and keep the area around it clean and hygienic. The area around your pool will remain lush green, and it will also help in maintaining the pool's cleanliness as there is no mud or debris in these artificial turfs. 

## Low Maintenance

You don't have to spend as much on the maintenance of artificial grass as opposed to natural grass. One does not have to make time for cleaning, fertilizing, or watering it like natural grass. You can easily clean it by brushing it once a week or just using an air drier. 

## Safe for Kids 

The cost of **artificial grass in Toronto** is between $10-$20 per square foot, including the installation charges. Your kids can easily play on this grass as these turfs have no chemicals, unlike their natural counterparts. Natural grass has to be fertilized with chemicals frequently to keep the shine, and it is not safe, especially when little kids play on it. These chemicals can also go into the water of the pool when placed next to it. 

## Mud-Free Backyard

Imagine your [backyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard){data-affiliate="520"} looks clean all the time and remains mud-free. Artificial grass needs no mud and has no moisture content, which makes it dirt and debris-free. Mud-free grass can make the pool and the area around it look clean. For example, if you are hosting a pool party, your guests can enjoy the pool space without making a mess of your backyard because of the mud. A mud and odor-free backyard is a dream for all outdoor space lovers. 

## Long-Lasting 

According to a report, one household in Toronto spends an average cost of $1050 per month on natural grass. The price is huge and not preferred by many people, and this cost includes all the spending used to maintain the grass and keep it long-lasting. 

However, synthetic grass lasts for long periods of time, even for years, without requiring you to spend much on it. It can also hold the weather condition of Toronto and keep the area around your pool dry and clean. Synthetic grass is a good choice for all outdoor decoration and is perfect for your pool area. If you are looking for shiny turf for your pool space, try artificial grass from an available online option.
