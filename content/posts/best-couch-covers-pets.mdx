I’m a proud pet owner of an amazing dog that I literally can’t stop loving. She’s adorable. Just one problem that’s really putting a damper on my sanity and the cleanliness of my house is the constant shedding. Tons of fur…everywhere. The couches especially take a beating since she’s always either looking out the window on one or hanging out with us on the other. Ultimately, couch covers are the best thing I could imagine to save your couch from dirt, hair, or claws.

## Which Sofa Cover is Best for Your Pet?

Well, every pet is different. You might have a calm, relaxed cat or a puppy that likes to jump on everything and play everywhere they can. Each living room and each pet needs a different type of couch cover.

Check out the guide and find the right one for you.

**BIGGEST WIN:** Machine washable so if they get it a little dirty you can just throw it in the wash and save that couch.

**ONE THING TO REMEMBER:** This is a Polyester and Spandex blend so it will attract FUR!  If your pup is a shedder, you probably don’t want to go with this one.

### 5. Modern Velvet Plush 4 Piece Sofa Cover

[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8NHT16?tag=fifti00-20){data-affiliate="268"}**PERFECT FOR:** That pet that loves to lounge around and won’t be scratching or harsh playing too often.

**BIGGEST WIN:**  This cover is awesome because it even wraps around the cushions.  You might not even know you have a sofa cover with this one.  It’s also velvet so it’ll be soft and comfortable for everyone.

**ONE THING TO REMEMBER:** These aren’t water resistant, so just make sure their paws are clean before jumping up.  They’re also going to show fur so if you have a shedder, I’d at least get a color that matches.

### 6. PetAmi Waterproof Pet Blanket

[](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HGDVR3Y?tag=fifti00-20){data-affiliate="269"}**PERFECT FOR**: You can either throw this on the couch for the well trained dog that will know to stay on the blanket, or a chair so a puppy can play there.

**BIGGEST WIN**: Reversible with a **waterproof** side and a **plush** side!  It’s also going to look fantastic and really blend in with the living room.
