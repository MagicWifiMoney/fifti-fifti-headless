Home improvements don’t need to cost a significant amount of money. If your home isn’t living up to its potential, you might want to make a few alterations to create a high-end design that will make you beam with pride day after day.

The following tips will not cost a huge sum and could improve your home’s appearance and ambiance. Read the following advice for designing a stylish home without breaking the bank.

## **Add Character with 20****th**** Century Furniture**

20th-century furniture can inject charm, history, and visual interest into a room, which will make your guests wish they lived in your home. Contrary to popular belief, vintage furniture items are more affordable than you might think and will give a room more character and texture. 

This [antique furniture store](https://thefurniturerooms.co.uk/){data-affiliate="1582"} provides stunning Art Deco and Mid-Century Modern pieces that will become a focal point in a living space. For example, you can trust you will never regret a timeless Mid-Century rosewood dining table or a glamorous set of French Art Déco Salon Chairs.

## **Install Wall Paneling for Texture**

Wall paneling was originally applied to interior homes to improve insulation and cover signs of mold. Nowadays, wall paneling adds a touch of luxury and elegance to a space, making a property appear more expensive than it is.

The good news is that wall paneling is an affordable way to decorate your home and could be cheaper than applying wallpaper. Also, you can choose from [many panel styles](https://www.realsimple.com/types-of-wall-paneling-shiplap-beadboard-7563853){data-affiliate="1583"} to add architectural interest and texture, such as:

- Wainscoting

- Shaker Style

- Wood slat

- Shiplap

- Geo paneling

When used well, paneling can emphasize a room’s height or horizontal space for a spacious, high-end aesthetic.

## **Draw the Eye with Statement Lighting**

Make jaws drop by installing statement lighting in one or more rooms across the home. For example, a sparkling chandelier will instantly add drama and elegance to a hallway, as it will draw the eye when a guest steps inside your home. 

The larger the statement light, the more luxurious a room will look and feel throughout the years. It is an affordable way to refine your interior design without blowing your budget. For instance, an ornate chandelier will add a splash of glamor and luxury to a living room, bedroom, and dining room. Also, oversized pendant lighting in groups of two or three could provide a [stylish finishing touch to a kitchen](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/decorating-ideas/g40093325/kitchen-lighting-ideas/){data-affiliate="1584"}.

## **Hang Large, Affordable Artwork You Adore**

A beautiful piece of artwork can add color, personality, and style to a space. You don’t need to invest in original works to create a stunning interior design, as you can buy large, affordable prints that will alter your home’s appearance and atmosphere. 

Find artwork that will fit a bare wall and complement your taste and [décor](https://fifti-fifti.net/design/home-decor-help-diy-decor-projects/){data-affiliate="1585"}. It will provide a stylish finishing touch to a room while helping you fall more in love with your home.
