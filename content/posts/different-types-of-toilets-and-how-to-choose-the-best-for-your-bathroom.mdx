Toilet shopping can be overwhelming! There's a wide range of options. Knowing the types and picking the best for your bathroom is key. From traditional gravity flush to modern dual-flush models, each type has its own advantages.

Before purchase, consider several factors:

- **Space:** Round bowls are good for small rooms, while elongated bowls are more comfy but need more room.

- **Height:** Standard or comfort height? Comfort height is taller, making it easier for people with mobility issues.

- **Flushing mechanism:** Gravity flush relies on water and gravity. Pressure-assisted toilets use air pressure – great for households with frequent use. Dual-flush toilets offer two flush options – liquid and solid waste – for water conservation.

- Other features to look out for include ease of cleaning, noise level, and materials used.

**Fun Fact:** Ancient civilizations had smart ways of dealing with human waste! The Indus Valley Civilization in 2600 BCE had bathrooms connected to drains with terracotta pipes!

## Different Types of Toilets

Toilet selection is key for any bathroom design. It's important to know the types of toilets available to make a great decision. Let's look at the most popular options:

Type
Description

1. Two-piece toilet
The most common – a bowl and tank. Easy to install and maintain.

2. One-piece toilet
A modern choice with a seamless design. Cleaning is simpler too!

3. Wall-mounted toilet
A great option for small bathrooms or trendy looks. They are directly fixed on the wall.

You can add extra comfort and convenience to your bathroom too. Consider these options:

- Comfort height toilets: Taller profile, great for those with mobility issues or tall people.

- Dual-flush toilets: Two flushing options and water conservation.

- Bidet toilets: Advanced hygiene features like washing and drying.

**Pro Tip:** When selecting your best toilet, consider space, preferences, and bathroom aesthetics. Get help from a professional if you need installation or specific requirements.

Make a perfect toilet choice that blends comfort, functionality, and style for your bathroom space.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Toilet

Be sure to select a toilet that fits in your bathroom space! Check the flush performance, to avoid clogs and save water. A round or elongated bowl? Comfort or standard height? It's up to you! For water conservation, choose a low-flow technology toilet. Think about your budget – there are options for all price points! Plus, some toilets offer extra features such as bidet functionality, soft close seats, and dual-flush options. A study by Consumer Reports found that the average lifespan of a toilet is **50 years!**
