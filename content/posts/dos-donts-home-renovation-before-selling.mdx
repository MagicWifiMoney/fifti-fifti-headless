Selling a home is never easy, and there are many tasks involved, from fixing up the property to staging it properly. One of the most critical aspects of preparing your home for sale is renovating it correctly. If you do too much, you might not get your money back when it comes time to sell. If you don't do enough, potential buyers might be scared away. This blog post will discuss the dos and don'ts of home renovation before selling!

## Do Consult With a Professional Before Making Any Changes

You might think you know what potential buyers are looking for, but it's always best to consult with a [professional](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/9-experts-you-need-when-building-renovating-why-katherine-koulizakis?trk=public_profile_article_view){data-affiliate="591"} before making any changes. This could be a real estate agent, a contractor, or even a home stager. They will be able to give you an idea of what potential buyers in your area are looking for and how much you should spend on renovations. You can also be sure your renovations adhere to rules or regulations set by your homeowners' association.

## Don't Go Overboard With Renovations

Doing too much work on your home before selling can also be a turn-off for potential buyers. They might not like your taste in paint colors or flooring and prefer to choose their own. If you've already made all the changes, they might be less likely to make an offer on your home. If you are unsure of what [things not to fix when selling a house](https://www.psbuyshouses.com/2022/09/06/what-not-to-fix-when-selling-a-house/){data-affiliate="592"}, it is best to ask your real estate agent for guidance. You can also search online; numerous articles and blog posts are written on the topic.

## Do Stage Your Home Properly

Staging your home is one of the most important things you can do when selling. This involves making sure the property is clean, clutter-free, and well-lit. You might need to rent some furniture or hire a professional stager or an [interior designer](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/9-benefits-of-hiring-an-interior-designer/){data-affiliate="593"} to help you make your home look its best. Staging is essential in selling and can significantly affect how quickly your home sells. Besides, it’s better to turn to a professional real estate photographer or take photos on your own and refer to [photo editing services](https://fixthephoto.com/real-estate-photo-editing-services){data-affiliate="594"} (it will be cheaper but professional as well).

## Don't Start Major Renovations Without Setting a Budget

Make sure to factor in the cost of materials, labor, permits, and anything else that might be required. Adding a contingency fund to cover unexpected costs is also a good idea. Once you have a [budget](https://www.fairstone.ca/en/learn/budgeting-and-saving/home-renovation-budget){data-affiliate="595"}, stick to it as closely as possible; otherwise, you might spend more than your home is worth. You might also leave your home half-finished, which could deter potential buyers.

## Do Get Creative With Your Design

While you don't want to go overboard with renovations, there's nothing wrong with being creative with your design. This is your chance to make your mark on the property and give it some personality. Potential buyers will appreciate seeing a home that is unique and stylish. Your patio could use some colorful [outdoor furniture](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/5-tips-for-the-perfect-finish-when-painting-your-patio-furniture/){data-affiliate="596"}, or you could paint the front door a bold color. Get creative and have fun with it! Just be sure not to do anything too drastic that could turn potential buyers away.

Keep these tips in mind if you're considering renovating your home before selling. With some planning and creativity, you can make your home more appealing to potential buyers without breaking the bank.
