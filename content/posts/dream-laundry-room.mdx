This has resulted in a deep appreciation for the magical machines I hear humming and tumbling as I type.

Eight years ago, my husband and I ran (literally) into KMart at 5:00 am on Black Friday. We were laser-focused on buying our first washer and dryer. Previously, we lived without them and this was it. Our way into the luxury of washing machine ownership, where you can wash your clothes while cooking dinner or sleeping.

We had no idea how truly grand the prize before us was. 

**A top load washer and front load dryer. **

The dream team. No high tech screens. A grand total of six settings, all operated by knobs. 

## Three Secrets for a Dream Laundry Room

A dream laundry room isn't only a beautiful one – but a functional one as well. Learn from these three tips for a functional laundry room you'll want to use.

### #1 Basic top load washing machines are your friend

I learned this following a bout of jealousy in regards to all my friends getting cool front loaders. My jealousy was reversed when everyone realized stagnant puddles of water in small spaces is the arch nemesis of fresh laundry. Thank you gravity and thank you, old, basic top loader.

So [spin dryer vs tumble dryer](https://gentlewasher.com/spin-dryer-vs-tumble-dryer/){data-affiliate="69"} – they both have their merits – but the factor that matters most is top load vs front load. And we say top load.

Here are some great top loaders at various sizes:[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row type="in_container" full_screen_row_position="middle" column_margin="default" column_direction="default" column_direction_tablet="default" column_direction_phone="default" scene_position="center" text_color="dark" text_align="left" row_border_radius="none" row_border_radius_applies="bg" overlay_strength="0.3&#8243; gradient_direction="left_to_right" shape_divider_position="bottom" bg_image_animation="none"][vc_column column_padding="no-extra-padding" column_padding_tablet="inherit" column_padding_phone="inherit" column_padding_position="all" column_element_spacing="default" background_color_opacity="1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity="1&#8243; column_shadow="none" column_border_radius="none" column_link_target="_self" gradient_direction="left_to_right" overlay_strength="0.3&#8243; width="1/3&#8243; tablet_width_inherit="default" tablet_text_alignment="default" phone_text_alignment="default" bg_image_animation="none" border_type="simple" column_border_width="none" column_border_style="solid"][vc_column_text]

During the 70s, the original homeowners decided to add a blue carpeted bathroom/laundry room combo onto the primary bedroom. It was in this blue laundry room, attached to a yellow bedroom (it was a lot), where I learned having a laundry room attached to your bedroom is a dream. 

I now live in a household of five people. Our laundry game is intense. This secret might be my favorite house advice for the laundry MVPs.

### #2 Your laundry room should be beside, if not inside, your bedroom

Your room will smell amazing and your constant trips to move towels from the washer to the dryer will be short. You can groggily start a load before brushing your teeth when you wake up. You can start a load before drifting off, while binging your favorite show in bed.

The laundry tackling possibilities are endless.

If you're in the market for a new home, add "laundry room next to your bedroom" to your list of nice-to-haves.

If you're going to be in your current home for some time, a good option might be a little addition to your bedroom. Though the [renovation will be a little bit more costly](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/4-ways-to-cut-costs-on-your-house-renovation/){data-affiliate="73"}, this may be a better option than trying to reconfigure your current setup and get proper washer and dyer plugins added on the fly.

### #3 Invest in Helpful Laundry Room Accessories

Laundry is a big deal – especially if you have a big family like me.
