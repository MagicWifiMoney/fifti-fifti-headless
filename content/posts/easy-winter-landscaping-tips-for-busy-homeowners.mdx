The thought of maintaining the exterior of your landscape as winter approaches and the weather drops can be intimidating. This is particularly daunting for time-pressed homeowners who are balancing a lot of obligations. However, knowing that a good curb appeal can enhance your property's value by 7% is inspiring. 

On the other hand, keeping a lovely and welcoming outdoor area in winter need not be a labor- or time-intensive project. You do not have to give up valuable time or energy to create a quaint winter wonderland and improve your outdoors with a few easy-to-implement landscaping ideas. 

We will look at simple winter landscaping ideas in this guide. These ideas will assist you in turning your outdoor area into a charming haven that's hassle-free and welcoming. You will learn everything from choosing low-maintenance plants to adding seasonal décor and making the most of outdoor lighting. Get ready to explore the world of cold landscaping and learn how to make your outside area shine, even in the coldest months. 

**Choose low-maintenance evergreen plants**

You can choose evergreens for your outdoors because they require minimal maintenance. Yet they will hold their color and foliage all winter long, even in a cold landscape. Evergreen trees and shrubs, like hollies, junipers, and boxwoods, offer minimal upkeep needs and throughout-the-year interest. 

These [resilient plants](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/flowers/perennials/perennials-designed-to-survive-harsh-winters/){data-affiliate="1853"} are perfect for busy individuals who want colorful and lush surroundings without having to deal with frequent upkeep. It is because they can withstand cold temperatures and bad weather.

**Apply a thick layer of mulch**

Mulching lowers the need for upkeep and offers simple yet effective wintertime protection for your plants and soil. You should cover your plants with a thick covering of organic mulch to insulate the soil, control temperature swings, and retain moisture. 

Try wood chips or shredded bark for mulching. Mulch keeps the garden looking nice and tidy with less work by suppressing weeds and preventing soil erosion.

**Let an expert take over**

Engaging a seasoned landscaping company can be an invaluable asset for time-pressed homeowners. You may lack the knowledge or resources to take care of your outdoor space. According to [Landscaping Provo](https://edgeut.com/){data-affiliate="1854"}, every facet of winter gardening, from plant selection and setup to ongoing upkeep and snow removal, can be managed by a skilled landscaper. 

You can enjoy a lovely and clean landscape all year round without the stress or inconvenience of doing your maintenance. It leaves your outdoor space to the expertise of a qualified professional.

**Install outdoor lighting**

During the gloomy winter months, outdoor lighting makes your landscape look more beautiful. It also increases security and safety. You can set up LED landscape lighting to draw attention to the important aspects of your landscape, such as trees, walkways, and structural components. 

Outdoor [lighting gives your outdoor area](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/how-to-decorate-your-outdoor-area-with-lights/){data-affiliate="1855"} more visual appeal. It also makes the atmosphere cozy and inviting for winter celebrations or evening get-togethers. You can take advantage of outdoor lighting without having to deal with the inconvenience of regular light bulb replacements. Select energy-efficient LED fixtures that are simple to set up and require little maintenance.

**Opt for simple designs**

Winter gardening for busy homeowners should be simple. You can select design elements that are simple to maintain and require little upkeep. Opt for basic geometric shapes and structures for your hardscape elements, like patios, retaining walls, and pathways.

You can also use well-placed [focal points](https://www.thespruce.com/creating-and-defining-a-focal-point-452316){data-affiliate="1856"} and sparse plantings to add visual interest to the garden without becoming overpowering. A clean and elegant look that is easy to maintain all year round can be achieved by maintaining your design clear of clutter.

**Plan for easy snow removal**

Clearing snow is an essential duty during the winter. However, it does not have to take a lot of time and effort. Pathways, driveways, and areas for entertaining should all be strategically placed in the landscape's layout to facilitate and expedite snow removal. 

You can install heated driveways or walkway systems. It helps you avoid snow and ice accumulation and reduces the need for shoveling or blowing snow by hand. Furthermore, to prevent damage during shoveling efforts, place snow storage areas carefully away from busy roads and fragile plants.

**Conclusion**

Busy homeowners can create a stunning yet low-maintenance winter landscape with the correct techniques and preparation. You can enjoy a beautiful outdoor space that requires little upkeep while still improving the curb appeal of your property by keeping these tips in mind. You can design a beautiful and feasible winter wonderland with a little forethought and wise decision-making.
