With any medium to large high-end property, you will probably have considered [installing a pool](https://fifti-fifti.net/yard/installing-a-new-pool-heres-what-you-need-to-know/){data-affiliate="1255"}. This can be a very sensible idea as not only can it make your home a better place to live, but it will also add to the value as well as make it more appealing to any potential buyers when the time comes.

These benefits will, of course, be dependent on you getting the job done properly. While having a pool that looks the part could potentially have buyers queuing around the block, something that is amateurish or inappropriate for the property can have the opposite effect and could end up as a millstone around your neck. To avoid any potential issues like this and ensure you don't blow the bank, follow a few simple steps.

## **#1 Ensure your pool is the right size for the property**

Everybody wants as big a pool as they can possibly afford, but that is not always the right way to go about it. Any potential buyers (or real estate agents that come around to value your property when the time comes) are going to want to see a pool that compliments your backyard, not take it over completely.

Ideally, the pool and the surround (where you might place sun loungers) should be no bigger than [between a quarter or a third](https://www.cohesivehomes.com/is-my-yard-big-enough-for-a-pool){data-affiliate="1256"} of your backyard area. You could go up as high as 45% but then stand the risk of it looking too imposing. You simply need to work out the total square footage of your backyard, and then you will know how big a pool you should have.

## **#2 Only use quality supplies**

If you are going to improve the quality of your downtime and boost the value of your property, you need to ensure that you get the right people to do the job and use the right material. This includes building materials and sourcing only the best [wholesale pool supplies online](https://txpoolsupply.com/){data-affiliate="1257"}. The same will go for pool maintenance after the pool is finished, and if you pick the right place, they won't cost the earth either.

This way, the pool stands the best chance possible of still looking good when you come to put your property on the market. Buyers should then see an appealing feature, not something that looks like a lot of work to maintain.

## **#3 Pick the right finish**

Unlike many other areas of the home, swimming pool finishes are not typically part of an ever-changing trend. This means that the chances of [making a design decision that dates quickly](https://www.insider.com/home-design-choices-that-dont-age-well-according-to-designers-2021-8){data-affiliate="1258"} are slim but not impossible. You just need to ensure that you do not go for anything too radical. Most pools will be blue, green, or grey, so picking something like black or pink, even though it might reflect your personal style, might be a wrong move for the future sale of your home.

## **A few final thoughts**

A pool is most people's idea of the ultimate luxury add-on for a home, but to pull it off, you need to get the size and the finish right so it doesn't look too big or too garish in your backyard. You should also ensure it is built and maintained using the best supplies so that it still looks as good as new to appeal to any potential buyer.
