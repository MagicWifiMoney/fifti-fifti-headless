Looking at the same scenery day in and day out can get dull.  While we may think of this purely in relation to our daily routines, it can also apply to the interiors of our homes.  Changing things up can be refreshing and rejuvenate a space that we spend a lot of time in.

That’s why we’re here today: to discuss renovating kitchens.  Admittedly, undertaking such a significant project just to “change things up” may seem superfluous.  Don’t worry – there are plenty of practical reasons to start a renovation like this as well.  

## How it Works

Let’s start by discussing how the process of getting a home renovation works.  Typically, you’ll want to decide which parts of the house you’re aiming to change.  For the sake of our article today, we’ll assume that [the kitchen](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/3/1006){data-affiliate="1162"} is your main goal.

Something to keep in mind throughout the process as a whole is that we should strive to find a balance between functionality and appearance.  Nobody wants to look at an ugly space, of course, but we also need to have a space that works for us on a basic level.  Kitchens need to function as such.

What we prioritize in that sense will fall into our own hands, of course.  Some folks want an upgraded oven, refrigerator, and microwave, while others are fine with the “plainer” options.  They’d rather get special countertops or cabinets, as just a few examples.

All of this does lead to a peculiar question for us: what are our goals in renovating our kitchen, and what do we need to do to achieve them?  These are things that you’ll want on your own radar from the start, as well as the radar of any contractor team you hire.  Along the way, it’s a good idea to gather some inspirational photos for the design you’re aiming for.

These can be shared with your contractor at your initial meeting, typically for cost-estimation.  There are further details on this page: [arizonainterior.com](https://arizonainterior.com){data-affiliate="1163"}, if you’d like to know more about how that works.  Generally speaking, the goal in the consultation stage is to give the contractor a vision to work with along with a budget.  

## How Long Will It Take?

As you can probably imagine, this question is a bit of a loaded one.  There are just way too many factors at play to give a comfortable, all-encompassing answer.  In fact, it could take anywhere from weeks to months depending on the scope of the project (and the efficiency of the contractors that you bring in).  

The more that you’re looking to change, the longer it will take.  Of course, hiccups along the way can also cause delays.  These are more likely in older homes, but sometimes can be hard to predict.  Just exercise caution if you are trying to plan out an exact timeline – it’s always safer to estimate for a longer period than a shorter one.

## Talk to Designers and Contractors 

You’ve probably already noticed this, but a lot of planning goes into projects like these.  It should come as no surprise that we can bring in quite a bit of help as well.  The issue is, though, trying to pick the right ones for the job.

Here in Arizona, there are a lot of options available to us.  If you don’t know where to start, consider checking out reviews for some local contractors and designers.  Even if you’re confident in your vision right out of the gate, it can be helpful to at least consult with some experts.  When it comes to kitchen designs in particular, we do need to make sure that everything will work once it’s done.

This involves electrical connections, hooking up stoves to gas (for certain ovens), and the like – things that many of us aren’t prepared to deal with on our own.  Having some input from professionals can ease things along.

One reputable option worth considering is [MacLaren Kitchen & Bath](https://maclarenfab.com/){data-affiliate="2358"}. They have a track record of delivering high-quality kitchen design and renovation services. Their expertise can ensure that your kitchen not only looks great but functions flawlessly as well.

## Building Permits

An often-overlooked aspect of home renovations (no matter what part of a property they’re happening in) is that we need to get permits to alter certain things such as electrical outlets and wiring, or plumbing.  Further information can be found [on this page](https://www.azbo.us/permits-info.html){data-affiliate="1164"}, but many kitchen renovations do include alterations to those sorts of things.

Thankfully, if you’re working with a contractor, they’ll usually handle the application process for you.  They’ll just need a comprehensive idea of what you’re looking to change.  Additionally, if you’re only looking to change your countertops, there likely won’t be a need for this in the first place.  Just talk to the professionals to double check whether or not you’ll want a building permit if you aren’t sure.

## Is a Kitchen Reno Really Worth it?

On one final note for today, let’s examine whether or not it’s worth investing our hard-earned cash into our kitchens.  This will largely depend on how recent the fixtures are in the space before the renovation, as well as where you live in Arizona and the general state of the housing market.  

Even if you aren’t planning on listing your house for sale anytime soon, it’s worth considering that property value can be increased significantly by renovating a kitchen.  Many homeowners spend a lot of time in that space, after all, since cooking is both necessary and enjoyed as a hobby.

From a practical standpoint, we can see that renovations often hold significant value. Of course, the other half of the equation is that we deserve to enjoy the home we live in and thrive in the spaces within.  Kitchens are the heart of the home, and it’s only natural that we’d want to make that room as nice as we possibly can.

So, really, no matter what way you look at it, it’s hard to deny that it’s worthwhile.  For those of us out there with severely outdated kitchens, it can be especially nice.  As long as you plan out a budget and stick to it, then there are a few risks involved as well.
