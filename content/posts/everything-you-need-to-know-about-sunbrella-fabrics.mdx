Almost everyone loves sitting outdoors to enjoy the warmth of the sun. This is why outdoor furniture is quite common in homes and public establishments. However, not every fabric can withstand the harsh weather conditions of the outdoors. This is why there are certain materials made specifically for this reason. 

If you are looking to get fabric for your outdoor furniture, you most likely would have read or heard of Sunbrella fabrics. If you are new to outdoor fabrics, chances are you do not know why [Sunbrella outdoor fabric](https://www.kovifabrics.com/category/sunbrella-fabric){data-affiliate="1283"} is one of the most popular and trusted brands out there. Well, we are here to educate you on that. 

In this article, we will discuss everything you need to know about this outdoor fabric. From what it is to its unique features and so on. At the end of this read, you will know everything you need to know to help you get the best when it comes to your outdoor fabrics. 

## **Meaning of Sunbrella **

Sunbrella is a brand name for outdoor fabrics made by Glen Raven Inc. These premium fabrics are known to be durable and of high quality. This is why it is a favorite for many designers and even DIYers. 

Apart from these two major reasons, Sunbrella also has certain unique characteristics that drive its popularity. In the section below, we will discuss some of these characteristics. This way, you’ll learn why this fabric will be a good choice for your next outdoor decoration project. 

## **Characteristics of Sunbrella Outdoor Fabric **

If you are like most people, you want to know the benefits you’ll get from choosing a particular item. Luckily, we have got you covered. Below are some of the most impressive characteristics of Sunbrella fabrics that make it a smart and right choice for your outdoor decoration needs. 

**Mold and Water Resistant **

One thing that tends to happen when some materials are used for outdoor furniture is the growth of molds. Molds are bad and can be quite damaging to our health, especially after long exposure to them. You can read [this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323419#prevention){data-affiliate="1284"} to find out the health implications of mold exposure. This is what makes Sunbrella a great choice since it’s made with acrylic. 

Because it is plastic, it does not absorb water. Regardless of how long it is left outdoors, water will not damage it. Being water resistant also means it won’t allow the growth of mold and other mildew that will damage your furniture and pose health concerns. 

**Fade Resistant **

These fabrics tend to keep their colors for years because they’re solution-dyed acrylic fabrics. What this means is that every string was colored throughout. This is unlike other materials that are colored only on the surface. Hence, exposure to rain, UV rays, and other weather conditions will not affect your Sunbrella fabric nor make it fade over time. 

**Easy Maintenance **

A lot of people do not clean and maintain their outdoor furniture, probably because of how strenuous this task can be. This often results in them looking worn out over time. But cleaning Sunbrella fabrics is so easy, so you won’t have any reason not to. Because of the high-quality porous materials used, you can clean the material with ease and make sure it always looks its best.

**Durable **

These materials are made using high-quality materials, which makes them very durable. If you properly care for them, they can last for as long as 10 years. The materials used (down to the sewing threads) are meant to withstand outdoor elements like UV rays, rain, chemicals, and other extreme weather conditions. 

**Certifications **

Sunbrella as a brand is certified by various regulatory bodies. One worthy of mention is its FACTS certification. Typically, a product to be FACTS certified will be evaluated to ensure it is environmentally safe throughout its lifespan. If you would like to learn more about FACTS certification and what it means, you can visit  [https://contracttextiles.org/](https://contracttextiles.org/facts-sustainability-certification/){data-affiliate="1285"}. This brand has over 50 patterns FACTS certified shows its commitment to producing quality and sustainable products for its customers. 

## **How to Maintain and Clean Sunbrella Fabrics **

Cleaning the acrylic materials made by this brand is quite easy, as we stated earlier. Typically, what you need to clean them is water and a little soap. Brush off the dirt from the furniture, then proceed to clean it using your soap and water mix. Once you are done with this, rinse off the soapy water using clean water. 

Cleaning the fabric like this daily will help it stay in pristine condition for the longest time. If you want to carry out a heavier cleaning, then you can pressure wash it. This would help you remove heavy dirt and debris from the fabric. 

## **Conclusion **

Sunbrella makes high-quality fabrics that are resistant to elements of harsh weather conditions. This makes it a good choice for various outdoor furniture applications. It is also easy to maintain and clean and won’t have you changing outdoor furniture now and then.
