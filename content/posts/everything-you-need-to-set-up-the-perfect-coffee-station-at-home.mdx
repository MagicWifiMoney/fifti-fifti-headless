There’s nothing quite as effective as a delicious, steaming hot, freshly brewed cup of coffee to get your day off to the perfect start. Whether you’re looking to set up a cozy corner of your kitchen dedicated to coffee or a full-fledged coffee bar, setting up a coffee station in your home is an easy way to organise your coffee essentials and make sure that everything you need is in easy reach for the morning. With the right coffee station, your morning routine can become more streamlined and enjoyable. 

In this guide, we’ll go over the process of creating the perfect coffee station in your home, from the equipment you’ll need to all the accessories that are worth investing in to make the space stylish and functional. 

## **Getting the Right Coffee Station Equipment**

Gathering all the equipment you need is the first step in setting up your coffee station. At the very least, you’re going to need a coffee maker. Depending on the type of coffee you’re making, you may also want to get a coffee grinder and a milk frother. 

- **Coffee maker:** Choosing the right coffee maker for you is the first step. Think about the type of coffee you like to drink and go from there. There are several options, including espresso machines, pod machines, drip coffee machines and bean-to-cup machines. SMEG offer a funky, retro-style range with different options to choose from. It’s worth exploring the [SMEG](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/everything-else/designers/smeg/){data-affiliate="974"} range, to get a better idea of what kind will work best for your coffee-drinking needs and of course, your budget.  
- **Coffee grinder:** It’s always best to grind your coffee beans fresh if you want the optimal taste. Unless you are going with a pod coffee machine, then investing in a coffee grinder can make all the difference to your morning experience. A burr grinder is a better option than a blade grinder. While you’ll spend more on it, it’ll last longer and provide a more consistent grind. 
- **Milk frother:** Unless you’ve gone for an espresso machine with a steam wand, a separate milk frother is a piece of kit that’s worth investing in. Simply put your choice of milk in, press the button, and it’ll create the perfect, textured milk ready to pour over the top of your brew.

## **Perfecting the Space with Accessories**

Once you’ve got the must-haves down, it’s time to customise your coffee station by adding some accessories that will make the space more stylish and functional. Some accessories you’ll want to consider adding to the space include:

- **Coffee mugs:** Invest in a good [set of coffee mugs](https://www.thespruce.com/best-coffee-mugs-4174198){data-affiliate="975"} that make your coffee station feel more complete and make it easy to get your cup of coffee started in the morning. You can hang them on a rack behind your coffee maker or get a stacking set. Choose mugs that are the right size for your coffee maker and that complement the overall aesthetic of the area. 
- **Coffee beans:** You will, of course, need some coffee beans to make your perfect brew. Get a good storage option to keep them fresh and handy for making coffee in the morning. Alternatively, invest in some coffee pods if you have this style of machine. 
- **Creamer, sugar, and syrups:** If you like your coffee plan then you can skip this step. But if you’re a fan of sweet coffee, then you’ll want to get some coffee creamer, sugar, and flavoured syrups to add to your morning brew. 

## **Styling and Organising Your Coffee Station**

Once you have all the equipment and accessories you need in place, it’s time to start focusing on styling and organising the set up to make it perfect for you. There are a few items you can get to make this easier:

- **Coffee storage:** Ideally, coffee should be stored in an airtight container, to keep it as fresh as possible and tasting great for longer. 
- **Pod storage:** If you have a pod coffee machine, then consider investing in a jar, basket, or carousel pod storage to [keep the pods neat and tidy](https://dengarden.com/news/coffee-pod-storage){data-affiliate="976"}. If you have a small space, you can get coffee machine stands with a pod storage drawer underneath that work well. 
- **Hooks**: Hanging up your coffee mugs can look great and keep them handy too. Consider adding some sturdy hooks to the side of or behind your coffee machine to keep your mugs in an easy-to-reach place. 
- **Cleaning supplies:** Cleaning up as you go is important when making coffee, as otherwise, you’ll get a lot of sticky, nasty residue. Keep cleaning sprays and clothes to hand at your coffee station, so you can easily wipe up any spills or clean steam arms after use. 

A coffee station can make your morning routine that little bit more enjoyable. Whether you’re a coffee aficionado already, or want to start making better coffee at home, keep these tips in mind to create the perfect coffee corner for getting your mornings off to an amazing start.
