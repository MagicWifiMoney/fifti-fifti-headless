Farmhouse sinks are a popular choice for vintage-inspired style kitchen renovations. With their large, deep basins and exposed front aprons, they instantly add charm and character to any kitchen. Research shows that 29% of people want to remodel their kitchen, either because their old kitchen had deteriorated or broken down. But installing a farmhouse sink in a small kitchen can be tricky because it takes up more space than a standard kitchen sink. 

If you have your heart set on a [farmhouse](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/what-is-farmhouse-style-decor/){data-affiliate="1353"} sink but are limited on space, don’t worry! With some smart planning and design, you can make a farmhouse sink work in even the tiniest kitchen. This article will provide quick and easy tips to help you install a farmhouse sink in a small kitchen while maximizing your available space.

## **1. Measure Your Space**

Before selecting a [farmhouse sink](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=farmhouse%20sink&linkCode=ll2&tag=fifti00-20&linkId=869208c4df997598bf08d2e036452589&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&#038;tag=fifti00-20){data-affiliate="1354"}, carefully measure your existing cabinet and countertop space. 

- Farmhouse sinks are generally available in widths ranging from 30 to 48 inches. 

- For a [small kitchen](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/8-tips-for-a-functional-and-stylish-small-kitchen/){data-affiliate="1355"}, a 30-inch wide single-bowl sink is likely the best option. 

- Measure the interior width of your sink cabinet and allow for 3 inches of clearance on each side when determining the maximum size sink that will fit.

This upfront planning will ensure your new sink will actually fit in the allotted space.

## **2. Opt for a Single-Bowl Design**

One of the easiest ways to save space with a farmhouse sink is to choose a single-bowl design instead of a double-bowl. 

- Choosing a single-bowl sink instead of a double-bowl sink can save you a foot or more of counter space.

- Single-bowl sinks come in all styles, and a farmhouse-style sink like the one [shown here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B8SWHQ1G?tag=fifti00-20){data-affiliate="1356"} still feels capacious.

Stick with a single basin, and you’ll have more room for meal preparation and entertaining.

## **3. Install in a Corner **

Placing your farmhouse sink in the corner of your kitchen is a great way to free up precious counter space. 

- Installing the farmhouse sink in a corner can maximize counter space.

- The corner location still allows for an attractive exposed front apron.

- Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure proper installation and drainage.

This clever positioning will help your small kitchen feel instantly more spacious.

## **4. Under Sink Storage Solutions**

While farmhouse sinks take up more visible surface area, you can actually gain storage space underneath. 

- Using the space under the sink for storage is another way to save space, as suggested by Homenish.

- Install pull-out cabinet organizers or slide-out trays to fully utilize all the available space.  

- Store lesser-used items like spare sponges, cleaning supplies, and trash bags under the sink.

Maximize every inch, including the out-of-sight areas beneath your new sink. 

## **5. Choose a Wall-Mount Faucet**

Selecting a wall-mounted faucet rather than a deck-mounted faucet will also give you some extra room.

- A wall-mounted faucet can save counter space.

- Since wall-mounted faucets are installed behind the sink, they free up several inches of space that would otherwise be occupied.

- Many wall-mounted faucets also feature pull-down sprayer heads for added functionality.

Free up precious counter real estate by moving the faucet off the countertop.

## **6. Optimize Your Sink Accessories **

The items you place around your sink, like drying racks, soap dispensers, and sponges, can also be optimized for space.

- Look for a drying rack or roll-up dish rack that can fit right over the sink when in use. 

- When not in use, it rolls or folds up out of the way.

- Install the soap dispenser right on the faucet to save space. 

- Opt for a small brush holder that mounts to the side of the sink for sponges and scrub brushes.

When choosing accessories, keep size and space limitations in mind for each selection.

## **7. Add Removable Cutting Boards**

For extra counter space when you need it, look for a removable cutting board or prep board that fits right over the top of the sink.

- These boards create additional workspace when lowered over the basin.

- When the sink needs to be used, simply lift the board off.

- Choose a board that is made of lightweight but durable plastic or bamboo. 

- Wood boards are not recommended as they can warp over time when exposed to moisture.  

This easy add-on provides a usable surface without sacrificing your clean-up area. 

## **8. Install the Right Cabinet**

Be sure that the existing cabinetry is properly sized and configured for your new farmhouse sink. There could be some challenges in installing the farmhouse sink. Look at the data below: 

**Follow these steps to install the farmhouse sink with ease: **

- The sink should fit into the cabinet with just 3 inches of clearance on each side.  

- The cabinet may need to be slightly wider than a standard-sized sink base.

- Custom or semi-custom cabinets may be required for an ideal fit.

Taking the cabinetry into account will prevent surprises during installation.

## **9. Create an Apron Front**

If your existing cabinet is not wide enough for a farmhouse sink, you can give it the look by adding a false apron front.

- Have your countertop supplier create the front apron out of the same material to match the sink.

- This will provide the visual of an exposed front without requiring a specialty sink base.  

- Attach the false apron front to the cabinet face for a seamless look.

With this DIY apron, you get the farmhouse style without using extra space.

## **10. Adjust Door and Drawer Hardware**

To prevent collisions between your sink and cabinet doors or drawers, adjust the hardware accordingly.  

- You might need to shift pulls and knobs to one side to ensure proper movement.

- Look for hardware that mounts on the outside of the door or drawer to provide adequate clearance.   

- Hardware with pull-out or drop-down mechanisms can clear the sink when opened.

Adequate hardware adjustments will ensure full access to storage areas. 

## **11. Allow Space for Backsplash and Fixtures**

When determining the measurements for your new sink, make sure to account for the additional backsplash and fixtures.

- Allow for 3-6 inches behind and around the sink basin for the backsplash tile.

- Make sure any fixtures like soap dispensers, filters, and drains will mount comfortably without interfering with backsplash tiles.

- Mark the measurements on the wall with painter's tape to visualize the full footprint before installing.

Careful planning will prevent clearance issues and mistakes.

## **12. Consider an Integrated Drainboard **

To maximize space around the sink perimeter, select a model with an integrated drainboard.

- Many farmhouse sinks are available with slightly angled drainboards built into the basin. 

- This provides a sloped drying space without requiring external dish racks or mats.

- Models with two integrated drainboard sides provide the most drying capacity.  

The built-in drainboard allows for washing and drying in one streamlined sink.

## **13. Install a Sink Front**

Some homeowners install a sink front panel that matches their cabinetry for a streamlined built-in look. 

- When paired with a wall-mounted faucet, the sink front removes any visible counter gaps.  

- DIY'ers can cut and attach a panel made of wood or composite board for an integrated look.

- There will still be space to wipe down and utilize the countertop behind the panel.

This approach will deliver a high-end custom appearance in even the smallest kitchen.

## **14. Choose an Offset Drain Position **

An offset drain position is a smart space-saving choice for smaller sink basins. 

- Opt for a drain that's shifted toward the back of the sink instead of centered. 

- This will leave more usable counter space in front of the basin for meal prep.

- It also accommodates slightly larger sinks that require the drain to be positioned off-center.  

Carefully selecting the drain placement maximizes your available counter space.

## **15. Evaluate Your Plumbing **

When replacing your existing kitchen sink with a farmhouse version, your existing plumbing may need to be adapted.

- The existing drain position likely doesn’t match that of the new sink. 

- Supply lines may also need to be extended depending on the new sink placement.

- A professional plumber can modify drain and supply lines to work properly with your unique space and sink.

Addressing plumbing needs ahead of time prevents headaches down the road.

## **Conclusion**

The key to successfully adding a farmhouse sink to a tiny kitchen is thoughtful planning and strategic space-saving solutions. Accurately measuring your existing space, selecting size-conscious styles and accessories, and creatively utilizing every inch will allow you to join the farmhouse sink trend, even with limited room. With an optimized layout and multi-functional furnishings, you can enjoy vintage farmhouse charm within a petite kitchen footprint.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**What are the standard farmhouse sink dimensions?**

The average size of a farmhouse sink is 30 inches wide and 20 inches deep. Smaller and larger size options are also available.

**How do I choose the right size farmhouse sink? **

Carefully measure your existing sink cabinet space, allowing for 3 inches of clearance on each side. Select a sink in a size that fits within those dimensions. An ideal farmhouse sink should maximize basin size while still fitting in the allotted space.
