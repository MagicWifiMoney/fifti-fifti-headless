If you’re a fan of interior design, you’re probably already familiar with the concept of feng shui. But did you know you can also apply this practice from ancient Chinese culture to your wardrobe?

Given the wardrobe is undoubtedly one of the most chaotic organisational tools in the home, applying feng shui practices to create harmony and balance with this piece of furniture is a great way to create a more positive living space.

## Wardrobe Layout and Placement

Moving your wardrobe to a specific place within your bedroom or dressing area can help encourage energy flow. According to feng shui principles, the wardrobe should be placed away from any pathways to the door – and not too close to your bed. [Fitted wardrobes are a great option](https://www.hammonds-uk.com/fitted-wardrobes/){data-affiliate="1201"} if you’ve found the perfect nook that fits this guidance but isn’t a standard wardrobe shape.

Feng shui also works in accordance with the [theory of Yin and Yang](https://www.thespruce.com/the-yin-yang-theory-and-feng-shui-1275241){data-affiliate="1202"}. When you’re applying this to the placement of your wardrobe, moving it to the left side of the bed (Yang) will help strike the right balance. Remember, if you have a mirrored wardrobe, make sure to position it *away *from any doors and windows!

## Colour Selection

The colour of your wardrobe can manifest different energies, so choosing the correct one is important. However, also picking a colour that resonates with your personality will also enhance the positivity in your bedroom.

### Yellow

In feng shui, yellow is an earth element that represents optimism. A yellow wardrobe can generate an easy-going, uplifting ambience that’ll remind you of relaxing days on the beach.

### Green

The colour of nature and the natural world, [green evokes relaxation](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-green-2795817){data-affiliate="1203"} and helps to instil a sense of well-being and inner growth. Feng shui principles recommend darker shades to stimulate deep thinking and paler tones for a good night’s sleep.

### White

This timeless colour is associated with cleanliness, confidence, and sophistication. White is also associated with the metal element in feng shui which denotes communication, precision and joy. 

## Quick tips to adjust your wardrobe design in accordance with feng shui principles

- Don’t put your wardrobe at the head or foot of your bed. This will stop you from becoming oppressed in your daily life.
- Avoid mirrored wardrobes if you can. They may cause ill health and sleepless nights. 
- Keep your wardrobe clutter-free. Belongings in disarray will negatively impact the balance in your bedroom.

Feng shui principles can be applied to every aspect of interior design, including your wardrobe! These quick tips and fixes will help you adjust your bedroom space to promote energy flow, manifest other great energies, and generally create a more positive [living space](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/affordable-living-room-design/){data-affiliate="1204"}.
