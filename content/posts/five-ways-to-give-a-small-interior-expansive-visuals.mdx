Every home deserves to look the way the owners envision it, but sometimes we see limitations to styling and designs. One of the most commonly heard complaints from homeowners is regarding smaller homes and how they end up looking congested despite the best efforts. This can be a legitimate concern since a compact home can often feel stuffy if you put too many elements into decorating the property. However, if you have seen the wonderfully aesthetic pinboards by top realtors, you’ll see how smaller homes, too, can be given a makeover for an airy feel. If you were looking for tips on how to ensure your home looks bright and spacious.

- **Minimalist decor: **Everyone has their own take on minimalism, but tends to get lost in translation. For us, the meaning of minimalism does not mean throwing away valuable materials to bring in a [bare minimum of home decor](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/interior/how-to-decorate-a-studio-apartment/){data-affiliate="548"}. Instead, one can make sure that every piece in the house has a specific function. For instance, your bedroom can be made more spacious by using an adjustable bed that expands when it’s time to sleep. The rest of the day, it can be folded to be used as your home office. Hydraulic convertible beds are a great option to look into.

- **Symmetrical furniture: **What makes small houses look smaller are asymmetric furniture and pieces which waste corners. Using furniture that can fit well into spaces and utilize these corners well can help you create the visual of an expansive space. Keep things simple and you’ll see how spacious your living room feels. Adding rectangular and elongated furniture can also add the illusion of length to your room.

- **Soft and neutral color palette: **The color coding of a room can change the depth and spatial perception. While painting a small room in darker shades can make it look tinier, switching to beautiful [soft roman shades](https://colorlux.com/products/shades/soft-roman-shades/){data-affiliate="549"} can help your room look classier- albeit with some more breathing room. Painting the walls soft ivory and choosing light-colored upholstery and bed linen can give a different dimension to your living spaces, making them look naturally spacious.

- **Strategic lighting: **The role of light in creating illusions of space or a lack thereof is highly vital. Getting plenty of natural sunlight is not just good for your health, but also can be a mood enhancer for your home! Having [long french windows](https://houseplans.bhg.com/house-plans/small/){data-affiliate="550"} that let light in during daylight hours can help you create the perfect summer aesthetic while installing strategic lights in low-lit areas can help you give the illusion of higher ceilings and more.

- **Paneling and vertical shelves: **Investing in vertical shelves is perhaps one of the biggest space savers in homes. If you have a conventional shoe shelf, switch it for a vertical one that can be installed on the wall. Similarly, your library can be fitted into the wall installment as well. Not only do you receive more walking space, but can enjoy freed-up tiles that make your home look bigger.

### Wrapping Up:

Your home can be beautified no matter what size of it is. However, you need to transparently note the strengths and flaws of the property to work on the latter. With the abovementioned tips, we hope you’re able to create more space in your house.
