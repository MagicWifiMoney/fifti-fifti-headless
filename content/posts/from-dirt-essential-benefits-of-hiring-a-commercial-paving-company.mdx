It is important to note that commercial paving services[ provide asphalt repair](https://www.thespruce.com/how-do-you-repair-asphalt-driveways-2132027){data-affiliate="723"}, not asphalt replacement.

## Concrete Paving

Concrete paving is another material used in the construction of roads and driveways. Like asphalt, concrete can be cracked and damaged. It is important to note that commercial paving services do not provide concrete repair. Instead, they will provide concrete paving services, which are much more expensive than asphalt paving services.

It is a process that helps you maintain the quality of your existing asphalt and prolong its lifespan.

## Line Striping

Line striping is a process that makes your existing asphalt look uniform and gives it a more professional appearance. It is important to note that line striping does not repair cracks in the asphalt. A commercial paving company will provide you with a quote before starting the job. Line striping will cost you more than asphalt repair because the cost of line striping is more than just repairing the cracks in the asphalt. It also includes creating a pattern for your roadway and installing signs for your road’s direction and speed limit. The cost of line striping depends on the size of your project and if you need to paint the lines or if they will be reflective.

## Pave Driveways And Sidewalks

Paving your driveway or sidewalk can be a very expensive project if you want it to look nice. You can hire a commercial paving company to pave your driveway or sidewalk for you. You can also pave your driveway or sidewalk yourself if you have the necessary skills and equipment. This will cost you less than hiring a commercial paving company, but it is still an investment in your business image if you choose to do it yourself. You can also use concrete pavers to pave your driveway or sidewalk instead of asphalt pavers. These pavers are more expensive than asphalt pavers but less expensive than concrete pavers.

## Lay Concrete For Outdoor Landscaping

## Cleanup and Maintenance Services

Commercial paving services will also help you clean up any debris left from their work and make sure that it does not get into the environment or cause any other damage to your property or neighborhood. You can also hire them to make sure that your driveway or sidewalk is properly maintained after they have paved it or replaced it with another material. They can also help you maintain your parking lot or parking garage if you have one.
