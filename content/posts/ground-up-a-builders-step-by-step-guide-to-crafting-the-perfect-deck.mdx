Building a deck is a very rewarding project. It is a wonderful way to get outside and enjoy the outdoors while creating a beautiful space to relax in. Whether you are building your first deck or upgrading an existing one, it can be a little daunting when you first begin.

The good news is that most homeowners do not have to do all the work themselves. A professional deck builder can take the time to plan the project, build the deck, and add the finishing touches.

# Hiring A Deck Contractor

If you are interested in hiring a deck contractor, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it is important to find someone who has experience in building decks. The contractor should also have a knowledge of the local climate and be able to account for any potential weather changes.

When[ interviewing prospective contractors,](https://www.americanfinancing.net/saving-money/contractor-hiring-interview-questions){data-affiliate="727"} it is important to ask about their rates and what services they offer. It is also helpful to ask about past projects they have completed and how those went.

It can be helpful to get a written estimate from the contractor before starting any work on the deck. This will give you an idea of what the final cost will be and help you make informed decisions about the project.

## 1. Level the Ground

Before you[ build a deck](https://fortress.builders/decks/bristow-va/){data-affiliate="728"}, you have to make sure the ground is level. It is important to check the ground in several places to make sure that it is as flat as possible.

You will need to dig a trench to make sure that you have the same amount of space on each side of the house. Any dips or bumps could cause problems when you are trying to attach the decking to the joists.

## 2. Install Joists

Joists are wooden beams that run along the length of a house. They support the weight of the deck and form the foundation of your deck. Joists are placed on top of your sub-floor and they are spaced approximately 16 inches apart. When you are building a deck, there are several different types of joists, some of which are more expensive than others.

The joists that you choose should be able to support the weight of the deck and they should be installed at least 12 inches apart. If they are spaced less than 12 inches apart, they will be too weak to support the weight of your deck.

## 3. Attach Decking

Once you have installed your joists, it is time to install your decking. Decking is typically made from pressure-treated wood or composite material. Decking is available in a variety of shapes and sizes, and it should be installed in accordance with the specifications that came with your decking. You can find decking at any home improvement store and you can also purchase it online.

If you are building a wooden deck, it is important to attach the decking to the joists before you install the decking boards. You can use screws, nails, or glue to secure the boards to the joists. This will help ensure that the joists are strong enough to support the weight of your deck.

## 4. Add Railings

Adding railings to your deck is an essential part of any deck project and it can help define your space and give it a finished look. A railing can be added at any time during the construction process. You can add it before you install the joists, after you have installed the joists, or at any time during the construction process. The railing will help define your space and give it a finished look.

## 5. Install Cement Board

Cement board is used to cover the joists and it provides a strong foundation for your deck. It will help prevent moisture from getting under your deck or rotting it out. You need to make sure that you use cement board that is designed for outdoor use and not cement board designed for indoor use. Some cement board is not designed for outdoor use and this could lead to problems over time. You should also make sure that you apply a waterproof sealer to help prevent moisture from getting under your deck or rotting it out.

## 6. Finish Finishing Touches

Once you have installed your cement board, you need to add the finishing touches to your deck. You can use paint or stain to cover any exposed wood and help protect it from moisture and pests. You can also add decorative accents like railings or lighting fixtures to help define your space and give it a finished look.

## 7. Decorating With Lighting And Patio Furniture

Once you have finished building your deck, it is important to[ take time to decorate it with lighting and patio furniture](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/the-best-summer-patio-decor-ideas-to-make-your-backyard-the-place-to-be/){data-affiliate="729"} so that it becomes a part of your home's décor and not just a piece of outdoor furniture that sits unused most of the time. Keep in mind that lighting fixtures and patio furniture will need to be moved periodically so that they do not become damaged by water and weather elements while they are outside. You can find lighting fixtures and patio furniture at any home improvement store or online retailer.

*Building a deck may seem like a daunting task but with a little planning and patience, you can find a professional deck builder who can take care of all of the details for you. By following these steps, you will be able to create a beautiful outdoor space in no time at all.*
