Nothing quite compares to the feeling of spending time in your own space outdoors, whether it's relaxing on a warm summer day or enjoying the crisp air of fall. When you're surrounded by the calming beauty of nature, the sound of birds chirping, and the gentle breeze, it's so much easier to unwind and escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

Naturally, you can't take full advantage of this small piece of paradise without having some sort of furniture to enhance your outdoor living experience. You can sit on the ground or a blanket for a fully authentic experience, but let's face it, most of us want something a little more comfortable. That's why it's so crucial to choose extra [cosy and weather-resistant patio and outdoor furniture](https://www.schots.com.au/outdoors.html){data-affiliate="1764"} to make the most out of your space.

## What Kind of Furniture Is Best for Outdoors?

There's no denying that the Aussie weather can be quite unpredictable – from heat waves to downpours, you never know what to expect. This never-ending whirlwind of elements can have detrimental effects on your outdoor furniture, so it's crucial to invest in quality pieces that can withstand harsh conditions.

### Concrete Furniture

Perhaps the most durable of all options, concrete is a material that is built to last. Not only does it have a modern and sleek look, but it's also incredibly sturdy and can handle heavy rain, strong winds, and intense heat without losing its shape or colour. While it does feature somewhat rigid edges and seemingly uncomfortable surfaces, you can easily soften it with cushions and pillows for a more cosy and inviting feel.

For instance, a concrete bench with cushions can be an excellent addition to your [outdoor space](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/patio-perfection-4-tips-for-maintaining-your-outdoor-space/){data-affiliate="1765"}, providing both functional seating and a stylish touch. Most models have a rectangular shape and clean lines, which means they can easily mix and match with other furniture and decor pieces. Similarly, you can use a subtle yet versatile concrete stool as an extra seat or side table, and if you add a pop of colour with a patterned cushion, you'll get both function and style.

### Metal Furniture

When we think about metal furniture, the first thing that comes to mind is usually an old and rusty chair or table. However, modern variations of outdoor metal furniture are far more refined and durable. As long as it's treated correctly—typically coated with a rust-resistant finish—this material can last for years. It's a particularly great option for those who live in coastal areas as it's highly resistant to saltwater corrosion.

While the cold and hard nature of metal may seem off-putting, you can quickly fix this by adding some outdoor cushions. Some options even combine wooden or rattan elements with metal frames, which ultimately reinforce their sturdiness and provide a more inviting look. Not to mention the fact that this material is relatively lightweight and easy to move around, making it a great choice if you like to rearrange your outdoor space frequently.

### Teak Furniture

Arguably the most classic type of outdoor furniture, teak is also one of the most durable and low-maintenance options. It's known for its natural oils that make it highly resistant to water and rot, as well as termites and other insects. Thanks to its innate sturdiness and warm, honey-brown colour, teak is a favourite among many homeowners who want to create an elegant and timeless outdoor space.

While it can be an expensive material, investing in teak patio and outdoor furniture is well worth it in the long run. You can keep it looking pristine by simply sanding and oiling it once a year, and with proper care, it can easily last for over 50 years. Plus, its natural look makes it blend in seamlessly with your backyard's greenery, creating a harmonious and organic feel.

### Heating and Cooking Equipment

To truly take your patio furniture to the next level, consider incorporating heating and cooking equipment into your setup. A backyard fire pit, for example, is a superb way to keep warm on those chilly nights while also enhancing the overall ambience. You can gather around it with friends and family, toast marshmallows, or even cook some food on an attached grill.

For those who enjoy hosting outside parties, a BBQ or outdoor kitchen setup is a great addition. With these features, you can host backyard barbecues and prepare delectable meals while taking in the fresh air and beautiful surroundings. It is also always a plus that cooking outside keeps your home clean and smoke-free.

## Additional Accessories for Your Patio

Aside from furniture and equipment, there are other elements you can add to your patio to elevate its look and function. For instance, pots and urns filled with colourful plants can bring some vibrancy into an already lush green space. Larger pieces like rectangular concrete planters or tall urns can also add some dimension and height to your patio's design. You could place them near your patio's entrance or in corners to add some visual interest and frame the space.

Accessories like teak sculptures, vibrant ceramic pieces, or even a quirky garden gnome can bring personality and style to your [outdoor living space](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-your-dream-outdoor-living-space/){data-affiliate="1766"}. However, it is important to remember that these pieces should enhance rather than overpower your furniture.

For instance, if you have a more minimalist patio setup, a bold and eye-catching statue might be just what you need to add some character. If you have a more eclectic style, you don't want to overcrowd your space with too many decorative elements.

Don't forget to also include functional elements like a doormat at the [entrance](https://homeimprovementcast.co.uk/what-is-the-foyer-of-a-house/){data-affiliate="1767"} of your patio. This not only helps keep dirt out of your house, but it also acts as a small yet impactful decor piece. Consider opting for a rubber or waterproof mat to withstand the constant exposure to outdoor elements. Of course, you can always switch out your doormat seasonally to keep things fresh and update your patio's look.
