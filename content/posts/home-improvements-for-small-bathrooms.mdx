When you are looking at improving your home, you should not forget the importance of making your bathroom a relaxing and comfortable space, no matter how small it is. Therefore, even if your bathroom is the tiniest room in your house, here are some improvements you can make to ensure that it both looks good and is a functional space. 

## **Shop for a Vertical Radiator**

If you want to improve the warmth of your bathroom and ensure that you always feel toasty when you get out of the bath or shower, you will need to look around for a powerful and small radiator. For instance, a vertical column radiator can be placed on small walls that are not very wide. These radiators will not take up as much space as their counterparts, and you can be sure that your bathroom will stay warm for hours after turning your radiator on. You may also decide to invest in a towel rail for this radiator which you will be able to dry your towels on after use. Therefore, you should look around for [vertical column radiators](https://www.warmrooms.co.uk/radiators/column/vertical){data-affiliate="977"} that you can use in your bathroom. 

## **Go for a Corner Bath**

You should also consider improving your small bathroom by [opting for a corner bathtub](https://foter.com/corner-tubs-for-small-bathrooms){data-affiliate="978"}. A corner bathtub is an excellent option as it will take up a space that would otherwise be left empty. Not only this, but a corner bathtub can leave the center of the room free so you can have enough space to move around and get ready. However, you will need to ensure that you have the right plumbing for a corner bath, and some tall people might struggle to get enough space in this type of tub. Try to map out the room well (on paper to scale or lifesize in another room) so that you can ‘walk’ around and see what works and where you might need more space.  

## **Opt for a Wet Room **

Instead of having a traditional bathroom with a tub and shower, if your room is that small, you should [opt for a wet room](https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-design-a-bathroom-wet-room){data-affiliate="979"}. A wet room can be a great option as it allows you to fit every fixture you need within your bathroom without them taking up a whole lot of space. Wet rooms are multifunctional spaces that are great for elderly people, young people, and even families. However, you should also be aware that drainage and mold can be a problem in wet rooms and that every item in the room will get wet as soon as the shower is turned on. 

## **Create Bathroom Storage **

Although you might not believe that bathrooms are the type of rooms where you can fit in a lot of storage, there are a lot of bathroom storage options out there. For instance, you might be able to [invest in a great bathroom cabinet or vanity](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/interior-projects/g42816493/best-bathroom-vanities/){data-affiliate="980"} where you can store all your cosmetics and washing accessories and products. You might also consider using a radiator shelf or a shelf within your shower to store the shampoos and shower gels you are using.
