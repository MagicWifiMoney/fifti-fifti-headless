Big cities have always been a mixed bag. On the one hand, they offer lots of career opportunities and an exciting social life. On the other hand, they suffer from more crime. As Australia's third-largest city, Brisbane is no exception. Its population has been growing, and so have break-ins and package thefts. Fortunately, smart home security systems are more effective and more affordable than ever. This article explores how Brisbane homeowners can benefit from modern access-control technology.

## **What Are Access-Control Alarms?**

Before we get onto why people might need [access control alarm systems in Brisbane](https://protecsecurity.com.au/security-alarm/){data-affiliate="4396"}, it is important to understand what they do. They are really a blend of two types of security system. First, there is the "access control" part, which managers who can enter a property and, in some cases, when they can do so. Keypads, biometric scanners, and smart doorbell apps are all types of access-control system.  

Alarms, of course, alert you or the authorities when the access-control system fails or is being tampered with. It may also try to deter the person who is attempting to gain unauthorized access. It is a backup plan, so it makes sense to combine them both into one system.

## **Common Security Risks in Brisbane**

Break-ins, theft, and vandalism are common crimes in Brisbane and its suburbs, as they are in practically all major cities. They tend to happen more in areas where the homes are older or the lighting is poor. Fortunately, most of these types of crimes happen while the owners are not home, although they can still feel very violated and traumatised even if no physical harm is caused.

Hopefully, fewer people will be the victims of such property crimes in the years to come. There are now many [smart tech solutions for home security](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-enhance-your-home-security-with-smart-tech-solutions/){data-affiliate="4397"} on the market, and they offer lots of benefits over traditional methods like locks, shutters, and window bars. They are also easier to adapt to suit the many styles of property found in Brisbane and nearby areas. Now, we'll get deeper into the benefits of access-control alarm systems in Brisbane.

## **Attempted Access Notifications**

One problem with relying on a simple lock and key for security is that unless somebody damages the door in some way, you have no way of knowing if anybody has tried to gain entry. Access-control systems keep a record of times when people try and fail to gain entry, which means you can alert the police and your neighbours, and maybe take extra precautions at home. But this is not the only way activity logging can help.

## **Authorized Access Logging**

Because it also logs successful entries, you can use it for things like making sure kids get home from school or Airbnb customers check-out on time. If you allow access to some strangers, like delivery or postal workers, you will know what time they arrived and how long they spent in your property. If things go missing, you will have a clear timeline that you can use to help the investigation.

## **Deterrent Effect**

The reason why older buildings and dimly lit areas are the most common targets for crimes in Brisbane is because criminals often look for easy targets. If they see that a building has cameras, security lights, or dogs, they are likely to look elsewhere. The same goes for alarms, and even simple access-control systems like doorbell cameras can work well as deterrents.

## **Emergency Response Requests**

Another way that modern alarm systems are superior to locks and keys is that both you and the authorities can be notified about break-ins in real time, even if you are not at home. Gone are the days when you would only find out about a burglary when you came home from work or a holiday. The sooner crimes can be reported, the better the chances are of catching the culprit and recovering any goods that were taken.

## **An All-Round Safety Solution**

By combining two functions, home-entry alarms are an efficient way to [help secure your home](https://www.police.sa.gov.au/nhw/home/news/secure-your-home){data-affiliate="4398"}. They can also make homes more convenient, integrating with other technologies to do things like turn the lights or air conditioning on when you unlock the door. In areas where they are widely adopted, crime often drops significantly. This not only makes Brisbane's residents safer, but it can bump up property prices and lower insurance costs too.
