- Mix baking soda and water to form a paste. Apply the paste to caked-on grime, letting it sit for at least 5 minutes before wiping off with a damp cloth.

- Fill a microwave-safe bowl with 500ml of water and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar. Microwave on full power for 5 minutes, then leave the door closed for 3 minutes to trap steam. Wipe the interior with a sponge, then dry with a clean cloth.

#### Step 3: Wipe Down the Exterior

- **Use a damp sponge** to clean the outside of the microwave, ensuring we remove any built-up grime.

- **Dry with a clean cloth** to prevent water spots. A clean exterior enhances the overall appearance of our kitchen appliance.

## Cleaning the Inside of the Microwave

Cleaning a microwave ensures efficient operation and a healthier [cooking environment](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/the-3-ways-to-create-a-professional-cooking-environment-at-home/){data-affiliate="4402"}. We can use several effective methods to tackle grease and food splatters.

### Method 1: Using Vinegar and Water

- **Prepare the Solution**: Mix **1 cup of water** with **1 tablespoon of white vinegar** in a microwave-safe bowl.

- **Heat the Mixture**: Place the bowl inside the microwave and heat on high for **2-3 minutes** until the mixture boils and the interior steams up, loosening food particles effectively.

- **Wipe Clean**: After letting it cool for a few minutes, we remove the bowl and wipe the interior surfaces with a sponge or soft cloth, ensuring we capture any loosened residue.

### Method 2: Using Lemon and Water

- **Prepare the Solution**: Combine **1 cup of water** with **slices of lemon** and squeeze the juice into the mixture in a microwave-safe bowl.

- **Heat the Mixture**: Microwave on high for **2-3 minutes** until the mixture boils and the steam fills the microwave, disinfecting surfaces while providing a pleasant citrus scent.

- **Wipe Clean**: Allow it to cool, then remove the bowl and wipe down the interior with a sponge, enhancing the aroma while cleaning.

### Method 3: Using Baking Soda

- **Prepare the Solution**: Fill a microwave-safe dish with **1 cup of water** and add **several tablespoons of baking soda**.

- **Heat the Mixture**: Microwave for approximately **5 minutes**, allowing the steam to loosen grime and food particles.

- **Wipe Clean**: Once the dish cools, we wipe the surfaces with a sponge or soft cloth, utilizing the mild abrasiveness of baking soda for stubborn stains.

### Tips for Stubborn Stains

- For tough grime, we can use a soft cloth slightly dampened with dish soap after heating the vinegar or water mixture, effectively removing any persistent residue.

- Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbers during the cleaning process to prevent damage to the microwave’s interior surface.

## Cleaning the Microwave Turntable

Cleaning the microwave turntable is a crucial step in maintaining overall hygiene and efficiency. Regular attention to this component enhances the cleanliness of our appliance and prevents stubborn stains from setting in.

### Step 1: Remove the Turntable

We start by carefully taking out the turntable from the microwave. Ensure that we handle it gently to avoid any potential breakage. Placing the turntable on a flat surface provides ease during the cleaning process.

### Step 2: Washing Options

We can choose between two effective washing options for the turntable:

- **Hand Washing**: We prepare a mixture of soapy water using mild dish soap and a non-abrasive sponge. We scrub the turntable thoroughly, focusing on any stuck food particles or stains.

- **Dishwasher**: We first check our microwave manual to confirm if the turntable is dishwasher-safe. If it is, we place it in the dishwasher for a thorough clean while ensuring that we use the appropriate settings.

### Step 3: Replacing the Turntable

We wait for the turntable to dry completely before returning it to the microwave. Using a clean towel assists in this drying process, ensuring there is no excess moisture. Once dry, we carefully place the turntable back in its designated spot, securing it in place for proper functionality during use.

By following these steps for cleaning a microwave turntable, we maintain a more hygienic cooking environment and enhance the appliance's performance.

## Cleaning the Outside of the Microwave

Cleaning a microwave’s exterior prevents the buildup of stubborn grease and smudges, ensuring our appliance looks fresh and operates effectively. By following these steps, we maintain a clean and hygienic environment.

### Step 1: Wipe Down the Exterior

- **Use a soft cloth or sponge**: Dampen a soft cloth or sponge with a mixture of water and mild dish soap to remove smudges and fingerprints. Wipe down the entire exterior surface with gentle circular motions.

- **Attention to stainless steel**: For stainless steel variants, choose a specialized stainless steel cleaner to avoid streaking and maintain its shine.

- **Baking soda option**: For stubborn stains, create a paste with baking soda and water. Apply it with a soft cloth, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse with a damp cloth and dry thoroughly.

- **Final drying step**: Ensure we use a dry microfiber cloth for a streak-free finish and clean the keypad and door handles, which are commonly touched surfaces.

### Step 2: Clean the Control Panel

- **Activate control lock**: For microwaves with touch controls, engage the control lock to prevent accidental activation during cleaning.

- **Choose the right cleaner**: Use a soft damp cloth to wipe down the control panel. Avoid spraying cleaners directly onto the panel; instead, spray onto the cloth for better control and reduced risk of damage.

- **Handle glass surfaces carefully**: If our control panel has glass controls, use an appropriate glass cleaner to avoid streaks and maintain clarity.

- **Dry with care**: Dry the control panel immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth to ensure no moisture remains, which could affect functionality.

By following these steps for cleaning the outside of the microwave, we enhance both the appliance's appearance and its longevity.

## Maintaining a Clean Microwave

Keeping our microwave clean is essential for hygiene and appliance longevity. A consistent cleaning routine not only enhances our cooking experience but also minimizes the risk of harmful bacteria buildup.

### Recommended Cleaning Frequency
