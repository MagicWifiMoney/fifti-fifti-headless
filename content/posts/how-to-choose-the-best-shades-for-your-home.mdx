If you're looking to add style and sophistication to a space, you can't go wrong with nice shades. Not only do they provide an elegant touch, but they offer great functionality and privacy.

With so many available options on the market, choosing the right type for your home can be a daunting task. Thankfully, there are steps you can take to make the process easier.

In this article, we’ll go over some important factors to help you choose the best shades for your home.

## Style and Décor

The first factor to think about when choosing shades is the style and décor of your space. You want your shades to blend seamlessly with the existing color scheme as well as any materials and design elements.

Look around your home and observe your current style. If it’s more traditional, you might want to stick with earthy shades such as cream or brown. On the other hand, if you have a modern home, you may spice things up with a bolder color.

It’s also a good idea to start browsing your different options. [Supreme Shades](https://www.supremeshades.com/){data-affiliate="1036"} is a great place to start as they have a wide selection to choose from.

## Budget and Installation

Cost is often a major consideration when choosing window treatments. Thankfully there are various options to suit everyone’s budgets.

If you want something more affordable, cellular shades are a great choice. If you don’t mind spending a bit of cash, investing in a motorized option that can connect to your phone or tablet is certainly luxurious – not to mention they can [add value](https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/advice/small-remodel-projects-add-value-to-rooms/){data-affiliate="1037"} if you decide to sell in the future.

## Light Control Needs

The primary function of shades is to control the amount of light that enters your home. Depending on your room’s purpose and direction, you might need different levels of light control.

For instance, in your living room, you may want to have a bright atmosphere full of natural light. However, in your [bedroom](https://fifti-fifti.net/bedroom/how-to-make-your-bedroom-aesthetically-appealing/){data-affiliate="1038"}, you may wish to completely blackout the sun to ensure a peaceful rest.

## Durability and Maintenance 

Shades are subjected to daily wear and tear, dust, and moisture. Therefore, it is crucial to choose an option that is durable, easy to clean, and low maintenance.

Types made of high-quality materials are more likely to resist warping or cracking. You may also find options with dust-resistant features that can save you time and effort when [cleaning](https://www.homemadesimple.com/in-the-home/50-cleaning-hacks-to-save-money-and-time/){data-affiliate="1039"}.

## Energy Efficiency 

Saving energy is great for your wallet and the environment. So keep in mind that shades can play a significant role in reducing your energy bills and carbon footprint. 

Generally speaking, cellular or honeycomb shades are the most energy-efficient. This is because they offer excellent insulation and light control capabilities.

## Add the Perfect Window Shades

While it can seem stressful at first, choosing shades for your home can be a fun process. By checking off the factors above you can be sure that you find the perfect ones to add functionality, beauty, and comfort to every space. Good luck!
