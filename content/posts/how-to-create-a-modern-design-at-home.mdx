Luckily, there are ways you can make some smaller and bigger changes that can do the trick and cost far less – especially in your [living room](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-decorate-your-living-room/){data-affiliate="488"}.

Simplicity is at the core of modern design. Using elegant, clean lines and neutral colors with bright accents can help you create a luxurious home that is both affordable and aesthetically pleasing. 

Remember that if you feel pleasant and comfortable in your home, so will everyone else who comes to visit or stay. The soul of your home lies in its authenticity so use the following tips in an effort to create a unique and modern design in your home.

## Declutter for Modernity

The [absence of clutter](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/declutter-living-room/){data-affiliate="489"} is what characterizes a modern home. Too much stuff and embellishments will create a fussy look. Remove everything you can and the space will breathe and appear to be bigger. However, this doesn’t mean there should be no decoration at all. Modern doesn’t mean sterile, so [opt for geometric designs,](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/looks/g30611534/geometric-patterns-shapes-room-decor-ideas/){data-affiliate="490"} clean lines and minimalistic ornamentation to achieve an elegant contemporary style.

## Use Modern Neutral Colors with Vibrant Accents

A [neutral palette](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/living-room-color/){data-affiliate="491"} is the best choice when it comes to the walls, floors, ceilings, and more oversized items in your home. Colors like whites, beiges, browns, greys, and blacks enhance the natural lines of your furniture and allow the details to stand out from the clean background.

To avoid an anemic look, incorporate eye-catching and distinctive accessories, such as original artwork, bright cushions, charming [area rugs](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-combine-area-rugs-with-an-open-floor-plan/){data-affiliate="492"}, and items that have different finishes and textures. Choose distinctive objects but don’t overdo it. 

## Update Your Bathroom and Kitchen to Complement

The kitchen and bathroom are the most important rooms in most homes and the ones that add the highest value in renovations. The kitchen, as the heart of the house, endures most of the wear and tear, so it should be given proper attention when the time comes. 

An [experienced custom home builder](https://www.sherbrookeconstructions.com.au/custom-home-builders-melbourne/){data-affiliate="493"} can help update your bathroom and kitchen to achieve your desired complementary design. Custom home builders have complete tools, experience, and expertise to perform the job with impressive outcomes.  

Custom builders excel in crafting kitchen and bathroom cabinets that seamlessly integrate with a home's design. They offer many benefits, including tailored designs, material and finish options, superior craftsmanship, and unique features like organizers and pull-out shelves.  

These cabinets are tailored to fit the available space and add value to a home. Custom builders can also align the cabinets with eco-friendly preferences. However, they are more expensive than off-the-shelf options, so homeowners should carefully consider their budget and project goals when choosing custom cabinets.

You may not be able to get the latest gadgets and appliances, but you can still modernize its appearance with a few simple touches. For instance, repaint your existing cabinet doors in a modern color and exchange old hardware with sleek, metallic ones. Also, update the backsplash and install new lighting, and in the end, you’ll have great results with small changes. 

The bathroom requires a similar approach. Regardless of its size, you can update certain elements that will elevate its overall appearance. Consider replacing outdated fixtures and installing a new shower head model, faucets and lights. Also, when [choosing the right design](https://www.renovationkingdom.com.au/blog/choosing-the-right-shower-head){data-affiliate="494"} of your new shower head and other fixtures, try and match them with the design of the bathroom, and even with the fixtures in the kitchen, for a complete look. 

A new floating vanity and a modern mirror over it will complement the entire look and add elegance and style to the space. 

## Upgrade Your Lighting Game

[Good lighting](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/living-room-lighting/){data-affiliate="495"} is an important design tool and plays a big part in inducing the change in interior design. Creative, strategically placed lighting can greatly complement your entire interior. 

Go for more affordable, low-voltage lighting and smaller bulbs set in pendants suspended from the ceiling for added visual effect. Add more contrast between the light and dark areas in your rooms but do it subtly to create your own statement. 

If you don't have room for a full overhead fan + lights, you may have luck with a [smaller fan](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-choose-the-best-small-ceiling-fan-for-a-tiny-home/){data-affiliate="496"}.

## Ditch the Carpets for a Modern Feel

Carpets are a thing of the past so if you want to achieve a modern look, ditch the carpets entirely and let your floors take center stage. Bare hardwood flooring, large square or plank tiles, and polished concrete can become a prominent feature of your home and provide a gorgeous finish with minimal fuss. 

Uncovered, they will enhance the modern appeal of your home, but you might also decide to use area rugs to add more definition to different areas in your home, such as the [living room](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/living-room-design-help/){data-affiliate="497"} and dining room. Pick the ones with simple lines so you can move the focus from them to the entire space as a whole. 

## Embrace an Open Floor Plan 

If you’re thinking of doing something more drastic, consider unifying your home with an open-plan design. Remove the walls separating your hall from the kitchen and living space, and create one combined space. The space will feel larger, cleaner and airier. 

Continue the same seamless look outdoors through large double doors leading onto your adjoining alfresco deck with modern outdoor seating. With such a contemporary design, you can spend more time with your family as you cook and eat together. 

When done well, a [modern home](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/4-perfect-additions-to-the-modern-home/){data-affiliate="498"} design creates a positive atmosphere and inspires creativity and joy. It can elevate your mood and make you feel comfortable in your own slice of paradise. With the tips mentioned here, you can make the right choices regarding the appropriate colors and design elements and achieve the look of style, comfort and modern aesthetics.
