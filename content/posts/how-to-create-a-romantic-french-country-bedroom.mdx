The Romantic French Country Bedrooms style makes us weak in the knees. Maybe it's the shabby chic furnishings, the soft color palette, or the feeling of being transported to a simpler time – similar to the look and feel of a [cottage-style bedroom](https://fifti-fifti.net/bedroom/4-essential-elements-for-cottage-style-bedroom-decor/){data-affiliate="449"}. Whatever it is, we can't get enough of it. 

One of the best things about Romantic French Country Bedrooms is that they can be easily achieved on any budget. You don't need to splurge on expensive antiques or designer furniture to get the look. Focus on finding secondhand pieces that fit the overall aesthetic.

Another great thing about this style is that it's relatively easy to change up if you get tired. If you're looking to add a touch of romance to your bedroom, consider adopting the French country style. Here are some tips on how to get the look.

## Start with the Basics

A good place to start when decorating any room is with the basics – in this case, that means choosing a color palette that reflects the romantic mood you're going for. Soft, neutral colors are always a good choice for a bedroom; think pale blue, ivory, or light pink. Once you have your colors selected, it's time to move on to furniture and fabrics.

One of the critical things to remember when creating a romantic French country bedroom is that this style is all about creating a peaceful oasis.

A chaise lounge or an upholstered armchair are both excellent choices, as they provide a place to relax and enjoy your space. And if you have the room, consider adding a dressing table or vanity – these pieces can help give your bedroom that luxurious feel.

## Select High Quality Fabrics

One of the things that makes the French country style so unique is its focus on high-quality fabrics and materials. When selecting fabrics for your bedroom, look for soft and luxurious ones to the touch, such as linen or cotton. You might also consider adding a few velvet or silk accents to give your space an elegant feel.

## Add Some Personal Design Touches** **

Finally, don't forget to add some personal touches to your bedroom that reflect your unique style. This could include anything from a vase of fresh flowers to a collection of family photographs. 

By adding these finishing touches, you'll create a space that's truly your own – and one that's sure to be ultra-romantic.
