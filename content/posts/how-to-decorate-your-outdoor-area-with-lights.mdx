The outdoors is much more than just an area for relaxation and enjoyment. It is a place where we can enjoy nature, meet our friends, family, and spend time with our pets. 

[Outdoor Lighting](https://vorlane.com/outdoor-lighting/){data-affiliate="823"} is one of the most important aspects of decorating your area. Lighting fixtures will allow you to spark up your space at night without worrying about electricity bills or wires running across the grounds. 

Here are some ideas for using different types of lighting to decorate your outdoors.

## **Use Lights To Enhance the Outdoor Aesthetic**

Outdoor lights add a festive glow and bring in features of landscaping and home to the forefront. You can use lights to highlight parts of your home, such as a garden or pool. They are also useful when you want to make an area stand out, like when you decide to build a deck on your property. 

Here are some ideas that you will love.

## **Create a Twinkling Pathway with String Lights**

Creating a twinkling pathway with string lights is a simple and effective way to add charm and ambiance to your outdoor area. String lights, also known as fairy lights or patio lights, come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be easily strung along a pathway, fence, or railing.

To create a twinkling pathway, you will need a string of lights, a ladder, and some basic tools like a hammer and nails or hooks. First, plan out the path you want to light and measure the distance to determine how many lights you will need. Next, install the lights along the pathway, securing them to the ground or a nearby fence or railing using nails or hooks.

Once the lights are in place, plug them in and turn them on to see the twinkling effect. For added safety, use outdoor extension cords and ensure that the lights are properly grounded. 

To create a more dramatic effect, consider using different colored lights or alternating between different styles of string lights.

## **Make use of LED Strip Lights**

LED strip lights are a versatile and energy-efficient way to add a touch of elegance and ambiance to your outdoor area. Whether you want to illuminate your patio, deck, or garden, these lights can be used in a variety of ways to create the perfect atmosphere for your space.

One of the most popular ways to use LED strip lights is to install them under the eaves of your porch or patio. This will create a soft and subtle glow that can be used to highlight architectural features or simply to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

LED strip lights can also be used to highlight specific areas of your outdoor area, such as a water feature, a garden bed, or a seating area. By installing these lights in specific areas, you can create a focal point and draw attention to the beauty of your outdoor space.

## **The Magic of Lanterns **

Whether you want to create a romantic ambiance or add a touch of rustic charm to your space, lanterns can be used in a variety of ways to enhance the look and feel of your outdoor area.

One of the most popular ways to use lanterns is to hang them from trees or posts in your garden or patio area. Another great way to use lanterns is to place them on tables or other surfaces in your outdoor area. 

Also, if you want to add a touch of rustic charm to your outdoor area, you can use lanterns made from natural materials such as wood or metal. These can be used to highlight the natural beauty of your outdoor space and create a sense of warmth and coziness.

Plus, you can use lanterns in your walkways, pathways, and driveways. This will create a sense of safety and security and make it easy for guests to navigate your outdoor space at night.

These come in a variety of styles, materials, and sizes, so it's easy to find one that fits your outdoor area's aesthetic and your budget. 

## **The Right Lights Can Make an Outdoor Space**

With the right lights, you can create a beautiful outdoor space that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. So first, think about how you want to decorate your outdoor space, allocate your budget, and finally, choose the right lights you want to install.
