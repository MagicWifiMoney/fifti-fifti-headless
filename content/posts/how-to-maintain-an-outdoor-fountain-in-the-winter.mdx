Any garden or backyard is made more elegant and serene by the addition of [outdoor fountains](https://clden.com/collections/outdoor-fountains){data-affiliate="1611"}. The practicality and beauty of these water elements, however, may be threatened by the severe weather as winter draws near, which affects [1 in 5 homeowners ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/winter-weather-survey){data-affiliate="1612"}each year. 

To maintain the longevity and functionality of your outdoor fountain, proper maintenance must be performed over the winter. In states such as Colorado, fountains can be an astonishing accent amongst the snowy landscape. So much so, that many people utilize fountains in their [outdoor living spaces](https://lifescapecolorado.com/2014/10/outdoor-rooms-with-year-round-appeal/){data-affiliate="1613"} in Denver. We will go over the crucial procedures and advice in this in-depth guide to assist you in properly managing your outdoor fountain in the winter.

## **Understanding the Challenges**

Several challenges come with winter for homeowners. These include: 

- **Temperatures Below Freezing:** Freezing conditions throughout the winter can cause water in the fountain to solidify into ice, which could harm the pump and other parts.

- **Debris Accumulation:** The fountain may get clogged with fallen leaves, twigs, and other debris, which would interfere with the water flow and choke the pump.

- **Growth of Algae: **The wintertime reduction in sunshine can foster the growth of algae. Algae can harm the surfaces of the fountain in addition to detracting from its aesthetic attractiveness.

## **Getting Ready for Winter**

**Clean up the Fountain******First, empty the fountain. To stop the water from freezing and creating harm, disconnect the pump and drain any leftover water. 

Clear the debris and give the fountain a good cleaning. To get rid of any mineral deposits or algae that may have collected during the warmer months, scrub the surfaces.

**Take Out and Store Parts******Take off delicate parts including ornamental embellishments, tubing, and pumps. To keep them safe from the winter weather, store them in a dry, covered area.

**Cover the Fountain**

You should think about using a weather-resistant cover for the fountain. It will be shielded from snow, ice, and debris as a result, minimizing damage and cleaning requirements.

## **Safeguarding the Pump**

**Choose a Submersible Pump**

Purchase a submersible pump that is resistant to freezing temperatures. Because of their design, these pumps can run in chilly weather without freezing.

**Set Up a Heating Device******If the winters are exceptionally cold where you live, you might want to add a tiny submersible heater in the fountain basin. This will shield the pump and keep the water from freezing.

**Check the Pump Frequently******Throughout the winter, it’s important to routinely check the pump even with protective precautions in place. Make sure it’s working properly and clear out any potential ice accumulation.

## **Stopping the Growth of Algae**

**Add Algaecide******Add an algaecide that is suitable for fountains to the water before winter arrives. By doing this, you can lessen the chance of algae growing in the winter.

**Repeat Cleaning and Treatment******When the fountain is covered, take off the cover from time to time to check for the presence of algae. When necessary, use an algaecide to cleanse the water and clean the surfaces.

## **Winter Fountain Visual Appeal**

**Accessories for Winter******Add some seasonal accents to the area surrounding the covered fountain to make your winter garden more visually appealing. To keep an appealing outside area, think about adding [lights or decorations](https://fifti-fifti.net/patio/how-to-decorate-your-outdoor-area-with-lights/){data-affiliate="1614"} with a winter theme.

**Removal of Snow******Remove the fountain cover lightly if snow builds up on it to avoid adding too much weight. Take care to avoid damaging the cover or any other parts throughout the process.

## **Spring Reopening**

**Examine Parts******As winter draws to a conclusion, thoroughly examine every component that has been stored. Before reinstalling, make sure there is no damage and give them a thorough cleaning.

**Fill and Proceed Again******Restart the fountain, add fresh water to it, and replace the pump and other parts. Keep a close eye on how it performs so that any problems can be quickly fixed.

**Maintenance of Landscapes******Use the spring reopening as an opportunity to take care of routine landscaping tasks. Reduce any overhanging branches, tidy the surroundings, and update the fountain’s appearance.

## **Final Thoughts**

An outdoor fountain must be properly maintained in the winter to guard against any damage and guarantee its durability. You can take pleasure in the beauty of your fountain all year round if you are aware of the difficulties caused by freezing temperatures, debris buildup, and algae growth, and if you heed the advice and guidelines provided. Remember that routine inspections and upkeep improve the general condition and allure of your [outside area](https://shedshomes.com/top-luxury-home-trends/){data-affiliate="1615"} in addition to maintaining the fountain’s functionality.
