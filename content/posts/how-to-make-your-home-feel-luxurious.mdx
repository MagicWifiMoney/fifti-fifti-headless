Elevate your home to a luxurious haven that you'll never want to leave! From mixing up your fabric choices to adding small touches of glitz and glam, you can make your home look expensive—without spending a whole lot of cash. With the right touches, you can make your home feel like a luxury oasis.

## Create Dimension by Layering Textures

Layering textures adds dimension to any space, creating a luxurious atmosphere. **From plush fabrics to smooth metals, each texture adds a unique quality to a room.**

Try varying the textures of your furniture pieces, like using wood with metal accents. Add a faux-fur throw blanket to a couch, or a sheepskin rug to a floor. Layer several throw pillows with different colors, textures, and patterns—the key is to have at least one unifying element so they feel cohesive together. For example, an earthy color palette with a textured pillow, a plain pillow, and a patterned pillow.

Consider using matte curtains in a room with glossy wood furniture, or add a patterned rug to a room with metal accents. Complement a smooth duvet cover with a plush throw blanket. Mixing and matching textures can make any room feel more luxurious.

Mixing materials adds visual interest, making the room feel more inviting and luxurious. 

## Create Height by Moving Your Curtains Up

You don’t need massive windows to make your windows look tall—though massive windows are certainly luxurious! Instead, just make sure your curtain rod isn’t sitting right on top of the window frame.

**Installing **[**decorative curtains**](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/the-perfect-look-decorative-curtains-for-every-room-in-your-home/){data-affiliate="1245"}** at a higher point on the wall—ideally as close to the ceiling as possible—can create a sense of height in a room.** By doing so, you’re adding a visual element by drawing the eye upward. Here are four ways to make your curtains stand out and create a luxurious feel:

- Choose a fabric that is eye-catching and will draw attention to the curtains.

- Layer curtains for more options; for example, a sheer curtain under a solid curtain

- Hang the curtains as close to the ceiling as possible.

- Add complementary accessories like tiebacks or decorative finials.

If you’re designing around a view, like decorating [a high-rise condo](https://www.ronneal.com/blog/most-expensive-condos-victoria.html){data-affiliate="1246"}, your curtain choice is all the more important. Keep things minimal and easily tucked away to appreciate a glorious view.

## Update Your Fixtures

Updating the fixtures in your space can create a more luxe atmosphere. **Simple changes such as replacing a sink faucet or swapping out your door handles can give your home an immediate style boost.** When selecting your new pieces, consider your home's overall style and select pieces that match. For instance, if you have a modern home, look for sleek, chrome finishes that give your home a luxurious feel. On the other hand, if you have a traditional home, opt for brass or bronze fixtures for a more classic feel.

There are many small hardware updates you can make throughout your home, from cabinet knobs and drawer pulls to light switch baseplates. For an extra touch of luxury, splurge a little—for example, get a touch-activated faucet rather than a standard one.

## Add Small Touches of High-End Materials

Small touches of high-end materials can instantly elevate any space, adding a hint of luxury and sophistication. To achieve this on a budget, consider adding:

- A marble-topped side table

- Antique gold accessories

- A set of vintage books

- A cashmere throw blanket

**These items will bring a touch of opulence to your home without breaking the bank.** To enhance the effect, add in some scented candles and high-end linens. You can also incorporate some unique pieces, such as a hand-painted vase or an ornate chandelier. Sometimes, just a touch is all you need to achieve an upscale look.

## Update Your Lighting

Upgrading your lighting can create a high-end, sophisticated look in any space. From chandeliers to wall sconces, fixtures can be chosen to suit any desired aesthetic. **Not only are there a multitude of styles to choose from, but also a variety of materials, including glass, brass, and chrome.** For those looking for a more modern look, LED lights are a great choice, as they can be used to create different levels of brightness or set to dim for a more romantic atmosphere.

Keep in mind the different types and [layers of lighting](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/6-tips-for-stylish-home-lighting-with-an-efficient-electrical-system/){data-affiliate="1247"}, such as ambient, task, and accent lighting. Just like layering textures, layering your lighting can create visual interest and depth.

To really make your space feel luxurious, opt for statement pieces such as a crystal chandelier or a sleek, gold pendant light. If you’re on a budget, sometimes swapping out an old, tired lampshade is all you need to give your living room a facelift. With the right lighting, you can easily transform your home into a high-end retreat.

## Choose a Large-Scale Statement Artwork

Art is a great way to [inject some classiness](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/8-ways-to-inject-classiness-into-your-home/){data-affiliate="1248"} into your home design. And, just like [creating an accent wall](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-choose-an-accent-wall-in-the-living-rom/){data-affiliate="1249"}, it’s meant to be a focal point. **Big artwork creates a clean, dramatic look.** Undersized art can look bare on a wall, while a gallery wall full of small pieces can look overly busy.

Hang your art at or just above eye level for easy viewing, and be conscientious in your frame choices. Having a mat between the art and the frame can instantly upgrade the appearance of the piece, and choosing a frame material that complements your other decor adds to the cohesiveness of the space.

## Use Classic Neutrals and Metallics

**Using classic neutrals and metallics in your home decor is an easy way to make it feel instantly luxurious.** Neutral colors like whites, creams, and grays allow for endless possibilities with other decor items, while metallics like gold, silver, and bronze add a hint of elegance and sophistication.

When used together, neutrals and metallics bring a timeless look that's perfect for creating a cozy and inviting home. To make the most of this classic combination, start by adding a few statement pieces to your living room or bedroom. A plush, neutral-colored sofa with metallic accent pillows, for example, provides a great starting point for transforming the space. A neutral wall color allows it to fade into the background, creating the illusion of more space.

Of course, bright colors aren’t necessarily a no-go. Save them for a true pop against this neutral background, like a statement vase on the coffee table or the aforementioned artwork.

## Include Houseplants and Fresh Flowers

**Incorporating houseplants and fresh flowers literally breathes fresh air into your home decor. **Here are four tips for adding greenery to your home:

- Use a variety of plants and flowers to create a lush, natural atmosphere.

- Place plants and flowers in unexpected places for a unique look.

- Choose plants that are low-maintenance and require minimal care. If your green thumb is a bit lacking, look into [hard-to-kill houseplants](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/11-hard-to-kill-houseplants-to-spruce-up-your-home/){data-affiliate="1250"}.

- Add a few accompanying accents, such as candles, vases, or baskets, to complete the look.

The addition of houseplants and fresh flowers make any home feel warm, inviting, and luxurious. Not only do they add color and texture to a room, but they also help make a house feel more alive. Additionally, the subtle scent of flowers can help create a calming environment. By considering these elements, any home can be instantly transformed into an inviting and luxurious abode.

Making your home feel luxurious doesn't have to be expensive. Small changes truly add up to transform the feel of a space. Plus, with a little creativity, you can refresh or rearrange existing pieces as a DIY project and create a space that’s both luxurious-looking and personalized. Imagine the possibilities of transforming your home into a luxurious haven with just a few simple steps.
