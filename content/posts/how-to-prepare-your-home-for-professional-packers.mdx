Getting ready for professional packers starts with simple steps that keep everything organised and easy to handle. Many people look to [moving companies in Darwin](https://readymovers.com.au/locations/darwin/){data-affiliate="4532"} for a smooth relocation, but a little preparation at home makes their work faster and safer. Here are practical ways to get your space and belongings ready before the packing team arrives.

## **Declutter and Sort Belongings**

Tackle one space at a time so you won’t feel overwhelmed. Sort through wardrobes, kitchen cupboards, and even the garage to see what can be sold, donated, or thrown out. Doing this early lets the packing crew work faster and saves you from paying to move items you no longer need.

A good clean-out helps you [maintain your home](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/home-owner-hub/maintain-protect/maintain-your-home){data-affiliate="4533"} before the move. Rooms will be easier to walk through, and you can spot repairs or touch-ups that need attention. Remember that less clutter also means less chance of items getting lost or damaged during the packing process.

## **Create a Detailed Inventory List**

When every cupboard is open and boxes start filling, it’s easy to lose track of what’s been packed. A quick way to stay on top of things is to jot notes in a notebook or build a simple spreadsheet as you move from room to room. Snap photos of fragile or high-value items to keep a visual record, such as your [living room decorations](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-decorate-your-living-room/){data-affiliate="4534"} or any artwork you plan to move.

This kind of list isn’t just about reassurance. It gives you something solid to check once you arrive and helps the packing team know which pieces need a gentler touch.

## **Secure Personal and Important Documents**

Gather important papers long before moving day. These might include birth certificates, passports, medical records, and property deeds. Place them in a single folder or small bag that stays with you during the move rather than in the moving truck.

Keep those papers with you so they’re harder to misplace or damage. Got digital copies saved on a laptop or phone? Make another backup, maybe a small USB drive or a cloud folder you trust. If someone suddenly asks for a birth certificate or property deed, you’ll know exactly where to find it without scrambling.

## **Label Fragile and High-Value Items**

A plain box looks like any other until you give it a clear warning. Bright stickers or a thick marker make it easy for the packing team to spot items that need a gentle touch. Write the label on more than one side so it’s visible no matter how the box is stacked.

Here are some label ideas you might use:

- Fragile

- Handle with Care

- Glassware

- Table Lamp

If you have a piece you’re especially concerned about, like a family heirloom or a handmade vase, mention it when the packers arrive so they can add extra padding or keep it separate.

## **Prepare Appliances and Furniture**

Large household items need attention before the professionals arrive. Unplug fridges and freezers, then give them time to dry so you don’t end up with damp spots or a musty smell. Disconnect washing machines and secure loose hoses.

For bulky furniture, remove cushions and any detachable parts. If a bed frame or table can be dismantled, keep screws and bolts together in a labelled bag. Clearing the space around these items gives the team a safe area to lift and wrap them properly without risk to your walls or floors.

## **Set Aside Essential Daily Items**

Set aside the things you’ll want right away when you reach your new home. A small suitcase with toiletries, a change of clothes, phone chargers, and a couple of kitchen basics such as mugs or a kettle will save you a late-night search through packed boxes.

This “essentials kit” saves you from digging through packed boxes when you arrive tired. It also helps if the moving truck is delayed or arrives after you do. Having these basics on hand makes settling in a little smoother and gives you breathing space before tackling the bigger unpacking jobs.

## **Arrange Clear Access for Packers**

Make it easy for the team to move in and out without obstacles. Clear driveways so the truck can park close to the entrance and check that hallways, stairs, and doorways are free from clutter.

If you have pets, consider keeping them in a secure room or with a friend for the day. This prevents accidents and allows the packers to work quickly. The smoother the path inside and out, the less time it takes to load and protect your belongings safely.
