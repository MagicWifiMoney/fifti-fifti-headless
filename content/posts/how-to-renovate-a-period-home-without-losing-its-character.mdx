Making changes to an older building can present a challenge. You might want to bring a given structure up to modern standards without compromising on the features and qualities that represent the period in which the building was constructed.

This often means spending more – but it's worth remembering that much of the value of a period home is derived from the features that mark it as belonging to a particular period in history. If you have a beautiful 18th-century cottage to work on, it might not make sense to equip it with double-glazing and chrome cladding.

## What Counts as a Period Feature?

Certain features define a period property, and others can be dispensed with without compromising on the look and feel we need. In many cases, you can trust your instincts (or those of your workers). 

In certain cases, the entire look of the home can be based on a certain style, which will date the house to a particular moment in American history. For example, during the 19th century, a Tudor revival was underway, with wattle-and-daub, black-timber construction being widely favored.

In other cases, a term like &#8216;Colonial' might be used to describe [a wide range of stylistic choices](https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/house-styles-architectural-eras-224060#:~:text=That%2520said%252C%2520there%2520are%2520various%2520defining%2520features%2520of,5%2520Window%2520shutters%253B%25206%2520Large%2520or%2520double%2520chimneys.){data-affiliate="2679"}. Since settlers arrived in the US from many different countries, they brought with them a wide range of philosophies about home-building.

## What about safety?

Period properties were built without [the restrictions of modern building codes](https://www.buildingsguide.com/build/building-codes-by-state/){data-affiliate="2680"}. When you're renovating a given period property, you might have greater freedom when it comes to these restrictions. It's nevertheless a good idea to use the best available materials where possible. 

## Getting a survey commissioned

By bringing in an impartial third-party surveyor, you can get a detailed view of a particular property and any surprises that it might be hiding. Older properties are notorious for coming with hidden problems, most of which are related to wear and tear. 

In some cases, a survey might help you [avoid making an expensive purchase](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/dont-let-these-home-renovation-mistakes-ruin-the-project/){data-affiliate="2694"} in the first place or give you greater leverage to negotiate a discount.

## Safety equipment for employees

Equipping workers with the safety gear they need will help you to avoid injury and other problems associated with working on unpredictable older sites. By forming [a strong ongoing relationship with a vendor like RS Americas](https://us.rs-online.com/){data-affiliate="2681"}, you'll have reliable access to the appropriate protective equipment.

## Prioritize the roof

The primary job of any home is to exclude rainwater. As such, your focus when conducting renovations should be ensuring that the roof is functioning properly. Make sure that the gutters are in good condition and are able to transport rainwater away from the building. Water damage is likely to undermine the character of your building, as well as its structure.
