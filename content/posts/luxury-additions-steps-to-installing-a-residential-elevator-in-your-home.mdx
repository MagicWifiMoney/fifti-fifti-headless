Installing a residential elevator in your home can be one of the most expensive additions you'll ever make. However, there are many factors that can lead to an elevator installation project costing thousands of dollars.

Let's take a look at the steps you need to take to install a residential elevator in your home.

# Hiring A Contractor To Do The Job

The first step in [installing a residential elevator](https://www.vacuumelevators.com/pve30-home-elevator/){data-affiliate="763"} in your home is hiring a contractor. It's important to hire a contractor with extensive experience in installing elevators and who is knowledgeable about the building codes and codes pertaining to elevators.

The contractor will provide you with the cost of the entire project, including the cost of materials, labor, and any additional costs that may be required. You must also pay for the elevator itself, which will be installed in your home.

## Selecting The Type Of Elevator You'd Like To Install

The type of elevator you choose depends upon the number of people you have in your home, the size of your home, and the layout of your home. If you have fewer than four people in your home, you may choose a residential elevator that's installed in a single room or hallway. If you have more than four people, a residential elevator that operates in multiple rooms is likely the best choice. This will allow you to accommodate your guests in a way that is convenient for everyone involved.

## Designing And Selecting Materials For The Cab Of The Elevator

Once you've decided on the type of elevator you want to install and you've identified the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other rooms in your home, you'll need to design and select materials for the cab of the elevator. When designing the cab for an elevator, consider how it will look in the room it's installed, how it will function, and how it will work to accommodate all of the belongings of each person who uses the elevator. If you have one or two people using the elevator, then the cab should be small and compact. If you have several people using the elevator, it may be necessary to create a large cab with plenty of space inside.

## Create A Pre-Installation Checklist

Before [hiring a contractor](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/the-exterior-benefits-of-hiring-a-siding-contractor-for-your-next-project/){data-affiliate="764"} to do the job, create a list of all of the items that must be purchased before installing an elevator in your home. These items may include:

- Materials for the cab of the elevator: The cab of an elevator must be made from materials that are strong enough to support the weight of people who use it and sturdy enough to hold up under everyday use. You'll need to select materials that are durable and safe for people who use an elevator.
- Materials for the door: The doors are also important because they need to be able to withstand wear and tear over time. In addition, they need to be weatherproof so that they won't rust over time. They also must be designed so that they can open easily and close easily.
- Materials for the base: The base of an elevator must remain strong enough to support and hold up the cab so it doesn't fall when it's being used. It also needs to be wide enough so that there's enough area for people to get into and out of the cab when it's being used.
- Materials for the stairs: The stairs need to be strong enough to support and hold up the weight of people who use them. They also have to be sturdy enough so that they won't collapse under the weight of people who use them.

## Check Off All Electrical Requirement For Installation

If you're installing an elevator in your home, you'll need to make sure that any electrical devices that are used in your home are compatible with elevators. Most electrical devices used in homes are either 110 or 220 volts, but if you're installing a residential elevator that operates on different voltage levels, you'll need to make sure that those devices will work properly with the elevator. You should also check with your local electrical inspector before installing an elevator because some states require that all elevators be equipped with an automatic door closer system. If there are any questions about whether or not your electrical devices will work properly with elevators, contact your local electrical inspector before you begin installing one in your home.

## Typical Cost Of Installing A Residential Elevator

Although there are many factors that can affect the cost of installing an elevator in your home—such as whether or not you have a mechanical license or if you're able to complete all of the work yourself—the typical cost of installing an elevator is between $12,000 and $15,000.1 The initial cost will depend upon how many [bedrooms and bathrooms](https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-decorating-a-beautiful-bedroom-1976169){data-affiliate="765"} are in your home and how many people are using the elevator at any given time. If you're installing a residential elevator for fewer than four people, then it may not cost as much as $15,000 just to install it. If you're installing a residential elevator for more than four people, it could cost more than $15,000 just to install it.

*In conclusion, if you're planning on installing a residential elevator in your home, be sure to check with your local electrical inspector before you begin any of the work. You should also make sure that all of your electrical devices are compatible with elevators and that you have the funds available to complete the installation. The cost of installing an elevator in a home can vary depending upon a number of factors, but it's usually not too expensive to do so.*
