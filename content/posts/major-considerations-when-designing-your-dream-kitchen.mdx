No doubt you already have a picture in your mind of how you want your kitchen to look and feel. However, there is more to designing a dream kitchen than just picking out unit doors and countertops. It takes planning and forethought. 

As this is probably one of the most expensive areas of a home to renovate, you need to make sure that you are doing it properly and that you are investing your money wisely.

## Reface Cabinets and Add Storage

Planning your dream kitchen also involves adding storage and redoing the cabinets. For this, [refacing kitchen cabinets](https://www.refacemagic.ca/services){data-affiliate="1076"} to align with the latest trends is a cost-effective option. Refacing consists of updating the cabinet doors, hardware, and colors to give a fresh look without replacing the entire structure. Trending colors for refacing kitchen cabinets include muted tones like soft gray, navy blue, or sage green. 

They provide a contemporary and timeless appeal. Likewise, to maximize storage, you should consider adding drawers, pull-out shelves, and organizers. Interestingly, focusing on kitchen cabinets and smart storage solutions can help you achieve a stylish and modern kitchen that meets your needs.

## Make Sure You Have Enough Electrical Outlets

With the number of countertop appliances now available that are proving to be highly desirable, you need to make sure that you have plenty of electrical points around your kitchen. They should, [apart from being chosen carefully](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/09/06/how-to-pick-kitchen-appliances/){data-affiliate="1077"}, of course, be well-spaced out, but this is more for aesthetically pleasing design than anything else. 

If, for instance, you have four or five countertop appliances, you are going to require a power source for each. It is unlikely that you are going to want to move them around your kitchen every time that you want to use them, and you are also going to want to have space around them so that they do not look like a shelf in an electrical appliance store. 

Although you can have electrical outlets added at any time, installing them at the earliest point possible will save time and money, as well as keep your kitchen looking its best when it is completed. So, get the floors done by [marmoleum flooring](https://www.atidymind.co.uk/how-to-find-the-best-floor-sanding-services/){data-affiliate="1078"}, and get the best professionals for all other renovations.

## Plumbing for Appliances

This also goes for plumbing for your kitchen appliances that require water or drainage to run. It is far easier for [new construction plumbing](https://www.beehiveplumbing.com/plumbing-lehi-ut/){data-affiliate="1079"} to take place before cupboards, countertops, and even certain types of flooring are laid, and no doubt it will work out cheaper too. However, this does mean that you will have to decide whereabouts your appliances, faucets, and drainage are going to go and what appliances you are going to have in your kitchen before any real work gets started.

## Provide a Social Area 

Most kitchens, even the small ones, can be improved by [having a social area included](https://edgewoodcabinetry.com/services/kitchen-cabinets/how-to-design-a-more-social-kitchen/){data-affiliate="1080"}. This could be just a couple of comfy seats or a small couch, or it could be in the installation of a breakfast bar if there is enough room. This is to provide the person that is stuck in the kitchen cooking with the ability to still be involved with any social event that may be happening rather than being isolated in a room on their own. It also means that guests can, if they wish, watch as any food or drink is being prepared.

## Create Your Dream Kitchen

You could start by making a list of all of the appliances that you want in your new kitchen, even as far as the make and model, and then plan with measurements where you want them to be located. You will need to think about drainage and water supply to those that require it, as well as the electrical points for them to function. Don’t forget about catering for when you have guests or when other members of your household are feeling sociable and would like to join you in your kitchen while you are preparing food and drink. They will need somewhere to feel comfortable while not getting under your feet or in your way.
