Kitchens have changed a lot over the past few decades, let alone when we look at the past century.  We’ve made all sorts of technological advancements that have allowed us to improve the way we cook and simply spend time in this part of our home.  This much is obvious just by looking around, though.  

What are some of the advancements that we’ve made that are particularly interesting and valuable?  Well, lately, there’s been a craze to move towards so-called “smart” kitchens.  Today, we’ll be exploring some of the options for upgrading to a smart kitchen, as well as how all of those components work together.

In particular, we’ll look at [touch faucets for smart kitchens](https://www.kraususa.com/kitchen/kitchen-faucets/touch-faucet.html){data-affiliate="1616"}, since you’d be surprised by how much of a difference they can make.  If you’d like to learn more about them, and how you can integrate almost all of your appliances into a “smart” space for your home, stay tuned!  

## What are Smart Kitchens, anyway?

In order to understand what smart kitchens are, first let’s explore what that moniker means.  Essentially, devices that are “smart” can connect to the internet and, by proxy, to other devices in a network.  That’s what makes them “smart.”  

 With that in mind, kitchens in this vein are modern and incorporate advanced technology with that internet connectivity to enhance the cooking and meal preparation experience.  They typically use a variety of devices and appliances that are all on the same network to help with preparation and even storage of food.  Let’s discuss some of the common features that could work well with a touch kitchen sink.

## Smart Appliances

The biggest staple in these spaces is, of course, [smart appliances](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6265443){data-affiliate="1617"}. The main thing to keep in mind is that they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.  Some examples include refrigerators, microwaves, ovens, coffee makers, and even dishwashers, though they’re certainly not limited to only those.

What’s the appeal, though?  Well, the main thing is that these appliances and devices can communicate with each other as well as the user.  Then, they are able to provide real-time notifications, remote control capabilities, and smart functionalities.

## Voice Control

This is something that has become quite popular in recent years.  You see, the integration of voice-assistant technology like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant enables users to control various kitchen functions through voice commands. In turn, this allows hands-free operation, such as adjusting cooking settings or checking recipe instructions.

When you have smart devices, you can connect them with voice control activated assistants as well.  Having multiple connections helps make things optimized, and adding in additional things such as touch activated kitchen faucets can provide you with a truly seamless experience while cooking.

## Energy Efficiency

One of the other main draws of this style of technology is that it allows us to be more [energy efficient](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/10-great-high-roi-energy-efficient-home-improvements/){data-affiliate="1618"}.  How does that work? Well, allow us to explain.

The main thing to be aware of here is that smart kitchens often include energy-saving features such as energy monitoring systems, smart lighting, and optimized power usage of connected appliances.  These features aim to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainable practices, all of which helps towards that goal of energy efficiency.

Of course, having touch activated faucets is another part of this puzzle.  When we have to turn sinks on and off manually, it can end up causing some issues as far as wasting water, even in small amounts.  Using alternative options can help reduce that waste.

## What are Touch Faucets?

Now that we’ve explained what smart kitchens are, let’s take a look at touch faucets in particular and what they bring to the table. Some examples can be found [on this page](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46547-0_3){data-affiliate="1619"}, if you’re looking to see how they can be integrated into a smart kitchen. 

As far as a basic rundown goes, touch-based kitchen faucets are also known as touchless or sensor faucets.  They are innovative and modern fixtures that use touch or motion sensor technology to control the flow of water.  Instead of using traditional handles or knobs to turn the water on or off, these faucets employ sensors to detect the presence or touch of a hand, triggering the water flow.

## How it works

How do these fixtures work in practice, then? Well, it’s pretty simple thankfully. The first step, generally speaking, is sensor activation.  In most cases, the sensor will be towards the bottom of the faucet so that our hands are already in place for washing when the water turns on.

Now, this doesn’t only apply to our hands.  If you have a dish near the sensor as well it will turn on, meaning that we can rinse and wash our dishes with similar efficiency. That’s one of the many reasons that they’ve become so popular, as you can probably imagine.

Another thing to note is that many of the options out there will include a few different water flow control settings. Thankfully, there should be explanations of the individual types in the instruction manuals that come with the faucet. However, you can also talk to customer service agents from wherever you purchase the model to get an idea of how it operates if you aren’t sure.

The purpose of the different settings is to help you change the pressure behind the stream, for the most part at least.  That way, when you’re washing a dish, you can use one pressure, but when you’re cleaning off some fruits or vegetables, it doesn’t have to be the same.  No one wants to damage their produce like that, after all.

Temperature control is another thing to keep in mind.  Usually, there are some sort of handles or gauges to help us adjust the temperature we want as needed.  Some will even let you save your preferences to use for later.

Overall, it’s not hard to see how a touch faucet can fit into a smart kitchen setup.  Hopefully, this guide will help you find one that suits your lifestyle!
