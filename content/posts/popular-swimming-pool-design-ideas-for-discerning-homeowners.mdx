Besides being a flaunt-worthy asset, a swimming pool enhances the value of your property and makes it sales-worthyin the long run. As a discerning homeowner, you may want to think beyond a rectangular design and pick a more eye-catching option for your backyard pool. Here are some popular design ideas for homeowners looking for nothing but the best. 

## Go narrow for a small space

Homeowners often skip the idea of a backyard pool due to space limitations. But you need not worry about a [small backyard space](https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/porch/outdoor-rooms/improve-small-backyard/){data-affiliate="569"} because a narrow design can easily fit into it. The best part is that you still have plenty of area for lounging and laps. Moreover, an expert designer can help you get enough space for your loved ones and friends to cool off without making a crowd.  

## Try an infinity pool

An infinity pool is not only for luxury resorts and hotels in exotic locales. You can mimic its look and feel in your backyard by collaborating with an expert contractor who knows the job. Try this design option if you have an excellent view, as it will enable you to enhance the area. Relax as you soak, sip your favorite drink, and enjoy the view at infinity's edge! 

## Add landscaping for a tropical vibe

If you love tropical holidays, you can actually replicate the beauty of your favorite destination in your backyard. Adding features like a waterfall and artificial rock to your swimming pool is an excellent idea. The project may sound expensive, but you can borrow a [pool loan to create](https://www.bluehaven.com/pricing-financing/pool-loan-calculator/){data-affiliate="570"} a dream look for your exterior space. Complete the tropical vibe by incorporating plants into the design. 

## Enhance the water features

Consider going the extra mile with water features like cascading waterfalls and bubbling fountains. These features look eye-pleasing, and your kids will love them the most. Discuss custom options with your designer and contractor because you can try one or more features to personalize your swimming pool. You can even check some trending ideas on popular home decor websites. 

## Play with shapes

A square or rectangular swimming pool in your backyard may look boring once the novelty wears off. Playing with shapes is a great idea as you can create a unique look with a circular or oval design. Add a show-stopping roof to create a whimsical yet [sophisticated vibe](https://www.forbes.com/sites/houzz/2014/10/23/10-ways-to-bring-charm-to-your-homes-exterior/){data-affiliate="571"} for the exterior space. If you love drinking and partying, you can integrate an outdoor bar and barbecue into the design.

Investing in a residential swimming pool is a great idea as it brings a resort right into your home. It makes a great entertainment zone for couples, families, and friends, so you must go ahead with the project without second thoughts. But explore your design options to create a dream outdoor ambiance for your home.
