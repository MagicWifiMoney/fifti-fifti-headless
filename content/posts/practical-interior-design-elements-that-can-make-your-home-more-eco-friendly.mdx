Starting a new interior design project can be a great time to add some personality to your living space. The great thing about these types of initiatives is that you can decide every element that goes into your home designs and turn an outdated room into a vibrant and exciting space.

But before you start making significant changes, it’s first essential to think about both the short- and long-term benefits they’ll bring to your living conditions. After all, it’s not just about aesthetics, and you want to make sure you can feel good about the decisions you’ve made, both with how the final outcome looks and how they support sustainable living practices.

The good news is that you don't have to choose between style and sustainability. There are plenty of features you can build into a room's design that prioritize a more eco-friendly living style. Here are a few sustainable design choices you can consider.

## Natural and Renewable Materials

When you're picking out materials for a new home build or when [tackling a renovation project](https://www.revive.realestate/areas/orange-county){data-affiliate="4746"}, you’ll have no shortage of choices when it comes to materials. But it’s important to remember that some of the materials you choose can be a much better option for the planet than others.

For example, when selecting different types of materials, consider sticking with natural and renewable resources like bamboo or reclaimed wood. Bamboo, especially, is a great material to work with since it’s tough and versatile, but grows significantly faster than other trees.

Using reclaimed wood can be a great way to extend the life of older materials by refinishing them and incorporating them into rooms to add charm and unique characteristics. Either of these choices is the perfect way to start lowering your carbon footprint as you make modifications to your living space.

## Smart Lighting Features

Your home's lighting setup can be another important factor when [considering the overall energy consumption of your home](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/10-great-high-roi-energy-efficient-home-improvements/){data-affiliate="4747"}. The good thing is that even making just a few simple changes to the type of bulbs or fixtures you use can make a huge difference on both the planet and your wallet.

A quick and easy improvement is swapping old incandescent bulbs for modern LEDs. This one change can lead to significant reductions in your monthly utility bills. LEDs typically last up to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs while using up to 90% less energy.

## Higher-Quality Furniture

Many [home remodels](https://www.revive.realestate/areas/san-jose){data-affiliate="4748"} involve buying new furniture to fit unique design layouts. While this can always be a great way to introduce a new style into your living space, it can also be a way to decrease or increase environmental impact.

Instead of simply trying to copy the same design trends, you might want to focus on using furniture pieces that are more durable and designed for longer-term use. This approach has a few advantages. For one, older, well-constructed items often have a much longer lifespan than many new, mass-produced pieces. Plus, using more pre-owned and refinished furniture pieces can actually create a very unique look and feel to a home while still reducing your environmental footprint.

## Chemical-free Paints and Sealers

When you're picking out materials, make sure you’re paying close attention to the building supplies you use. A prime example of this is in the type of paint and sealers you use. Unfortunately, there are still a number of these products that contain harmful substances called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

When used in large volumes, VOCs can release toxins that are not only bad for the environment but can also cause respiratory problems for you and your family. Before you start painting, make a point to research any building materials that are labeled as low-VOC or VOC-free. This way, you can get the aesthetic you want without worrying about hidden health risks.

## Eco-Friendly Water Fixtures

Just like energy costs, increased water consumption can lead to high utility costs while also having a negative impact on the environment. By [making smart improvements to your kitchen or bathroom areas](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/recipe-for-a-modern-kitchen-how-to-blend-tech-and-design/){data-affiliate="4749"}, you can help to keep this consumption to a minimum whenever possible.

For example, a very practical way to cut your water use is to replace old plumbing fixtures with newer, high-efficiency versions. This includes faucets, showerheads, toilets, dishwashers, and washing machines. Making these improvements throughout your house can lead to substantial water savings throughout the year.

## Sustainable Fabric Choices

The textiles you choose throughout your space can also be a way to [add more sustainable options to your home](https://fifti-fifti.net/design/top-trends-in-sustainable-homes-for-2024/){data-affiliate="4750"}. These can come in various materials, such as the curtains on your windows, rugs, blankets, or towels.

While you may not realize it, traditional fabric manufacturing often relies on heavy chemical treatments and larger amounts of energy. To avoid contributing to this environmental impact, try opting for natural fibers like organic cotton or linen. These are almost always a much better choice.

## Setting Up Multifunctional Spaces

Outside of the materials you use when you're renovating your living space, the actual layouts you use in your design can also contribute to a more eco-friendly lifestyle. For example, instead of creating a layout that depends on having separate rooms, you could create more adaptable floor plans that reduce construction and material needs.

A good way to achieve this is by creating a dining or living room area that can double as a home office. You could also look into modular furniture, like sofa-beds or tables that fold away or extend, to accommodate different use cases. The more flexibility you build into your home, the less need you'll have to buy new materials, add new flooring, or purchase extra furniture down the road.

## Make More Responsible Design Choices

Making more thoughtful interior design choices benefits not just your living situation, but also the planet. By following the discussed strategies, you’ll ensure you make responsible design choices that add more value to your home while helping you live a happier and healthier life.
