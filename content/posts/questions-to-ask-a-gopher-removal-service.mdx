These tunneling rodents are notorious for damaging [lawns](https://fifti-fifti.net/exterior/sod-lawn-installation-with-mr-lawn/){data-affiliate="1486"}, gardens, and crops by burrowing extensive networks underneath the ground. Consequently, numerous homeowners discover the necessity for expert gopher eradication services. 

Nevertheless, before hastily selecting a service provider, it is vital to inquire about certain essential aspects. Here are four fundamental questions that will aid in choosing the most suitable removal service.

## 1. What Methods Do You Use for Gopher Removal?

The first question aims to understand the service's techniques for [gopher removal](https://gopherstop.biz/){data-affiliate="1487"}. Various options are available to address the gopher issue, ranging from traps to poison-free solutions. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, but choosing a service that prioritizes humane and environmentally friendly techniques is crucial.

Some companies have developed innovative and eco-conscious methods that remove gophers and prevent their return. These methods are safer for your family, pets, and environment than traditional trapping or poisoning approaches.

## 2. How Quickly Can You Respond to a Gopher Infestation?

When faced with a gopher infestation, it's crucial to act swiftly. These critters can wreak havoc in no time, causing significant damage. Time is of the essence, so take action. A reliable gopher removal service should be able to respond promptly, ideally offering same-day service.

In addition, the service should be able to exterminate the gophers entirely within a few days. Any delay could lead to further damage to your property, so inquire about the company's response time and duration to effectively carry out gopher removal.
