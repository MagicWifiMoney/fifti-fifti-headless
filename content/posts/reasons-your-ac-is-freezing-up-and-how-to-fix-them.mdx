AC is something that helps people save from the intense and scorching summer heat. At times, they work the whole day and even during the night. An individual should keep in mind that they are machines after all and hence are prone to breakdowns at some point. An AC may get frozen. The freezing up of ACs happens a lot, and users need to be vigilant about it. No one wants a cold [living room](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-decorate-your-living-room/){data-affiliate="483"} – or any room in the house for that matter.

Not many users are aware of the fact that their AC can get frozen up. Hence, they don't understand when it happens. With the help of a few tips, this problem can be solved. If the problem persists, you should call for experts [**when your AC unit freezes**](https://allmastersplumbing.com/what-to-do-when-your-ac-unit-freezes-up-in-arlington-tx/){data-affiliate="484"}. 

## Signs to Check Your Freezing AC

One of the most significant issues of a freezing AC is ice accumulation. When you remove the panel and see ice accumulated on top of it, you know the problem has started occurring. Another way to understand this condition is by checking the supply registers. Are they warm? If yes, then you should know that you are having a freezing problem. 

## Blocked Air Flow Causes Freezing Up

An air conditioner must have [constant airflow](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/no-aircon-no-worries-heres-how-to-keep-cool-without-it/){data-affiliate="485"} so that the humidity does not get settled over the coils and, as a result, freeze over there. To ensure this flow is proper and doesn't disrupt the functionality, one needs to ensure clean air filters. 

Clogged air filters restrict the airflow and disrupt the machine's proper functioning. The good news is that AC filters are inexpensive and can be changed easily at regular intervals. Tuned and cleaned machines are an excellent way to prevent potential problems.

## Steps to Defrost Your Air Conditioner

### **#1- Thawing the Ice on Air Conditioner**

The first step to getting started with defrosting your air conditioner is to thaw the ice. The unit needs to be turned off at the breaker since this will allow the ice present on the coil to evaporate. After the ice thaws, dry up the water from the unit by soaking a sponge or towel. Once dried up completely, one can start the machine. 

### **#2- Check for the Coils, and Examine Air Filters**

When ice accumulates on the unit, airflow gets blocked, and the machine must work hard. This results in it becoming a glacier. It is, therefore, necessary to check for the air filters and replace them if required. If ice is still showing on the unit after changing the **air filters**, the evaporator coil can be the problem. 

Yes, along with the filters, the coil should be clean to ensure airflow is not obstructed. Switch off the unit to clean the coil and do it with the help of a soft-bristled brush. Be vigilant when using tools or equipment to clean up the coil. Anything abrasive will damage it.  

### **#3- After Observing Coolant Level, Start The Unit**

If there is ice on the [AC line](https://www.lennox.com/buyers-guide/guide-to-hvac/glossary/refrigerant-lines#:~:text=Refrigerant%20lines%20are%20two%20copper,return%20line%20or%20vapor%20line.){data-affiliate="486"}, it may indicate low refrigerant. Get the leaks inspected by the experts, and if required, they will perform the required repairs. When the troubleshooting of the problem is done, you can start over the unit again to relax. 

## The Bottom Line for AC Issues

You should act on the problem soon when you know why the AC unit accumulates ice. Keeping the components of your AC clean is integral to ensuring the system functions well. **When your AC unit freezes**, try to look for the problems; if they are minor, you can work on them on your own. This will not only help one save considerably on the costs but will also ensure maximum efficiency.
