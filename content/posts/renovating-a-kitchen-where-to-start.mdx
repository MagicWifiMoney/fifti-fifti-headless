It's estimated that the average homeowner[ spends nearly $27,000 on a kitchen remodel](https://www.angi.com/articles/how-much-should-kitchen-remodel-cost.htm#:~:text=Normal%20range%3A%20%2414%2C612%20%2D%20%24,the%20scope%20of%20the%20project.){data-affiliate="1835"}, yet depending on the size and scope of the project, the cost can range anywhere from $14,000 to more than $40,000. It's also estimated that the average kitchen remodel takes anywhere from six to eight weeks to complete (or up to 12 weeks for a more intensive job).

Noting all of this, getting your remodel right is imperative – and it all starts from the very beginning. In this post, we'll cover how to prepare for a kitchen remodel before you even break ground.

## Kitchen Renovations: Where Do You Begin?

### Commit to the Project

It's one thing to talk the talk, it's another thing to walk the walk. Kitchen remodels involve a lot of different moving parts and can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to complete depending on the significance of the remodel. Noting all of this, simply committing to a kitchen renovation is a great start. In addition to committing to a [kitchen remodel](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/trendy-kitchen-remodel-ideas-that-you-must-try/){data-affiliate="1836"} project with confidence, you'll also need to commit to it financially. We'll get into more of that later on in this piece.

### Do Your Homework

After you've committed to a kitchen remodel, it's important to do your homework to ensure that the end result fully meets – or even exceeds – your expectations. And a big part of this is making sure you're putting in the time and effort to do the necessary research before you break ground on your project. For instance:

- Research all the products and materials you'll need to consider for such a project and the suppliers and manufacturers in your area that you may be able to source them from. It also helps to research prospective pricing points so you can help set a realistic budget.

- Spend time thinking about the design of your kitchen. Will the renovation include opening up any walls in an effort to make the space more functional?

- Is there a theme you're looking for in your kitchen? For instance, do you want a modern contemporary kitchen, a rustic look and feel, one that's meant for entertaining, etc.?

Before you hire a designer or a contractor to work on your project, make sure you have a good idea of what you're looking for.

### Assess Wants vs. Needs

Next, it's time to balance what you need in a kitchen versus what you want in a kitchen. This step will also be largely dictated by the budget you set for such a project. Some of your considerations may include things like:

- Adding existing counter space or a kitchen island.

- Adding custom cabinets to match the look and feel that you're striving for. Many homeowners assume that their only cabinet options are the ones in stock at their local big box store. However, you can order custom cabinets that incorporate a specific wood type, pattern and color to zero in on any [kitchen style](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/classic-vs-contemporary-choosing-the-right-kitchen-style-for-your-home/){data-affiliate="1837"}.

- The amount of storage or pantry space.

- If brand-new appliances are necessary.

- The type of flooring you want to install.

We suggest making a list of all the various components you identified in the research phase of your planning and then deciding what you need to have versus what you want to have based on a projected budget. From there, you can determine how much your "needs" cost and work some of the "wants" into your budget if there's room to spend.

### Hire a Designer and/or Contractor

Once you've done some of the legwork, then it's time to get serious about breaking ground on your project. Research local designers and contractors in your area and get estimates from at least three of them. In many cases, you may even find a design-build contractor who will handle both the design and construction aspects of the project rather than having to hire two separate entities.

Don't just base your decision on price, there are various other factors to weigh when making this important decision. These include:

- Reputation: Read online reviews and ask to speak with any former clients.

- Communication: Make sure you know how to get a hold of them and what the best way to communicate with them is.

- How soon the contractor can start and how long they estimate the project will take.
