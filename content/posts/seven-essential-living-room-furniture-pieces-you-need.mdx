Whether you are a first-time buyer or are looking to renovate your home, the likelihood is that you’ll soon be looking for furniture to fill your home – and this is especially the case with your living room, where you’ll be spending the majority of your time. 

So, to assist you in your search, here are 7 essential living room furniture pieces you need to consider. 

## 1. **Sofa **

The start of any great living room is, of course, the sofa. It will likely be the largest and most used piece of furniture in your living room, so getting the right one can set the mood for the rest of the room – it's a focal point that you can build the rest of the room around. 

When choosing a sofa, don’t just look at the price (though budget will always be a huge consideration). It is important to test out a few to make sure it is comfortable and luxurious, it's the right shape for the room, and that it perfectly suits the colour scheme you are going for. 

In addition, it's worth remembering that a sofa is an investment – paying that little extra can mean you get a sofa that lasts longer, making the purchase more worthwhile. 

## 2. Comfortable Mattresses

In addition to sofas, chairs, and coffee tables, comfortable mattresses can also play a key role in creating a cozy and inviting living space. Whether you're hosting guests in your Australian home or simply lounging with your family, a comfortable mattress can provide the perfect spot for relaxation. Just make sure to shop from a reputable brand which also offers attractive discount deals. 

For instance, you can get [mattress for sale sydney](https://sydneywidediscounts.com.au/store/bed-frames-mattresses/){data-affiliate="883"} in a variety of options and that too, at affordable rates. When selecting a mattress, consider factors such as size, firmness, and material to ensure that it meets your specific needs and preferences.

## 3. Coffee table 

After you have chosen your sofa, it's time for the coffee table. If you have an L-shaped sofa, the coffee table should nestle comfortably within the centre – for regular sofas, it shouldn’t be longer than the size of the couch. 

Getting the right coffee table can ensure that your snacks and drinks are within arm's reach at all times, but not close enough that it restricts you from stretching your legs. It's a shared place that all the family can use and gather around, and so due consideration should be given. 

## 4. **Electric fireplace **

A fireplace can give any living room a warm, cosy vibe. If you don’t have a traditional fireplace in your home – or, even if you do and are looking for a more eco-friendly alternative, for that matter then you might consider an electric fireplace. 

There is a multitude of [electric fireplace and fire options to choose from](https://www.onbuy.com/gb/electric-fireplaces~c9491/){data-affiliate="884"}, including models with colour options, remote-controlled, freestanding, built-in, log effect, modern, traditional, and much more!  

## 5. **TV stand **

[Choosing a TV, streaming service, plug-in smart media device](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/tv-buying-guide,review-1943.html){data-affiliate="885"}, and so on, can be an exciting part of designing your living space. However, from a more functional perspective, you will also need a stand that can house all your devices, whilst still looking chic and stylish. 

## 6. **Side tables**

Whether it's for holding any accessories, decorative pieces, TV remotes, books, or simply for added ease, side tables can be a fantastic addition to your living room. 

Depending on your desired aesthetic and available floor space, there are a variety of styles to choose from. For some, a country-style wooden unit with iron handles can be great – for small spaces, stackable side tables might be a better option. 

Check out this website that offers customized tables.

## 7. **Lamps **

Your living room will no doubt have overhead lighting, but it shouldn’t end there. There are three aspects of lighting you must consider when designing any room – [ambient or general lighting, accent or decorative lighting, and task lighting](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-light-fixtures-5219783){data-affiliate="886"}. 

For example, if you are an avid reader, you might opt for a table lamp near your seat to light up the pages – this is an example of task lighting. However, if you prefer the warm glow of a freestanding lamp, this is known as ambient lighting. 

On the other hand, accent lighting is the use of light to highlight specific design features within the room, such as lighting up artwork, cabinets, or plaster mouldings. 

## 8. **Accent chairs **

And last, but not least, accessorize your new furniture with accent chairs. These chairs can pick out on the colours in your color palette, contrasting yet complimenting your sofa. You can then pop some gorgeous pillows and throws on the chairs and sofa to bring it all together.
