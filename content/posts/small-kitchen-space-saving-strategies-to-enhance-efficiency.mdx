Being the heart of a home, the kitchen can hold some special memories for you and your loved ones.

While a big, spacious kitchen is appealing, finding one in densely populated cities is often impossible. However, appropriate strategies can make compact kitchens equally efficient and stylish.

Let’s discuss these strategies in detail and discover the best ways to transform your tiny, messy kitchen into an organized, efficient one.

## Making The Most Out Of Vertical Spaces

The main issue that often arises because of the small kitchen area is storage space. Properly using empty wall spaces can easily resolve this issue. Adopting open corner shelves can provide comparatively more space. 

You can also add cabinets that go all the way up to the ceilings. They will provide you with additional storage space.

You can install open shelves on one side of your kitchen to make the kitchen look less narrow.

Bigger appliances like microwaves and ovens can take up a lot of countertop space. Built-in ovens and microwaves can quickly resolve this problem.

So make sure to use every nook and corner of your kitchen. This will help you keep your kitchen more organized and efficient. 

## Adopting a Freezerless Refrigerator

A refrigerator is one of the most important appliances in a kitchen. It usually takes up a lot of space. 

And as we discussed, space is the most critical issue in a small kitchen. Hence, adopting [freezerless refrigerators](https://www.pcrichard.com/freezerless-refrigerators/){data-affiliate="3923"} is the most effective way to address this issue. These refrigerators also have the features of built-in ice and water dispensers. 

[](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/how-to-remodel-your-kitchen-a-simple-guide/){data-affiliate="3924"}Plus, with the option of a customized panel, you can tailor it to complement your color schemes perfectly. Go ahead, be creative, and customize the panels to the best of your imagination. 

If you are worried about where to find these freezerless refrigerators – don’t. In today’s world of modern technology, you can easily avail them from online websites. So, stop waiting, open your laptops, and start looking for them right now.  

## Cordless Device

With the limited space available in small kitchens, it can be quite difficult to install multiple switchboards. Devices, like wired air fryers, mixers, and grinders, can make the countertop look unorganized. 

Therefore, opting for cordless devices will help you keep the kitchen space organized and decluttered. In addition to energy saving, being cordless also makes these appliances easily portable. You can store them in your storage area and retrieve them only when needed.

## Installing Hooks

Using hooks can be a great way to store items that take up a lot of shelf space. Articles like pans, pots, spatulas, and even [decorative items](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/decorating-ideas/g1872/decor-ideas-kitchen/){data-affiliate="3925"} can be put up on these hooks.

Hooks can be installed anywhere, from walls to the openings of your storage shelves. So, plan the installation well to make them easy to access.

Be creative, add as many hooks as you like, and create extra space for your bulky items.

## Utilizing The Space Below Your Kitchen Basin

The space below your kitchen basin usually goes unnoticed, which can result in wasting storage space. 

Installing a kitchen cabinet can be one way to deal with this. The cabinet can store dishwashing and [kitchen cleaning accessories](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-kitchen-cleaning-products-7107041){data-affiliate="3926"} like soaps, liquid detergents, scrubbers, and more. 

Another way to use that space to its full potential is to install a small built-in dishwasher. They are the perfect time-saving and hygienic dishwashing solutions. Along with saving your energy, they will also help you in saving water.

In addition, you can also utilize the empty space by installing your garbage bins under the basin for easy access and usage.

## Using Foldable Chairs

Having a separate dining table in a small kitchen can be a problem. Instead, using foldable chairs can provide your kitchen counters with dual functionality.

Folding chairs are easily moveable and portable. They can fit around and under countertops. You can even store them in a separate room and bring them out only when needed. 

They also come in different shapes and sizes; you can choose the chairs of your own liking and design your kitchen accordingly. 

## Conclusion

With the right amount of [creativity infused](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/recipe-for-a-modern-kitchen-how-to-blend-tech-and-design/){data-affiliate="3927"} with our space-saving strategies, you can make your small kitchen have a huge impact. So take out your pages and pens and design the kitchen of your dreams, combining your ideas with our strategies. Make sure to maintain and clean your kitchen. Nothing brings people together like good food. So make the best use of your space and the best of memories with your loved ones.
