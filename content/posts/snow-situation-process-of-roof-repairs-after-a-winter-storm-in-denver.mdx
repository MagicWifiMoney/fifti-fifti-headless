As the weather gets colder and the snow starts to fall, it is not uncommon for roofs to sustain damage from snow and ice. If you are the owner of a roofing company in Denver, you may be faced with the task of repairing the roof after a storm. Here’s a look at common damage that may be encountered after a storm and the process of repairing a roof after a winter storm.

# Hiring A Denver Roofing Contractor For All Winter Roof Repairs

If you are in need of roof repair or replacement, it is important to choose a professional [Denver roofing contractor](https://roofingcenter.com/denver-co-roofing-contractors/){data-affiliate="690"}. A roofing company with the experience and expertise to handle all types of winter weather will be able to better assess the damage and make necessary repairs quickly and efficiently.

### Common Roof Damage After A Storm In Denver

When it snows in Denver, the snow and ice can accumulate on your roof in a variety of ways. This can include:

-Damage to flashing: Flashing is a metal cover that covers the joints between roof tiles and helps keep water out. Snow and ice can crush or tear these covers, allowing water infiltration into your home.

-Wet insulation: When the snow melts, it can turn into a heavy liquid that runs down roofs like rain. This liquid accumulation can cause the insulation to rot, leading to leaks and potential water damage.

-Insect damage: Insects such as ants love icy roofs, so they may travel up onto the tiles for food or shelter. Once there, they may crawl into any breaks in the tile or shingle covering, damaging them beyond repair.

In order for your home to properly withstand winter weather damage, it is important to have a team of professionals who are equipped to handle all aspects of roof restoration – from assessing the damage to fixing it right the first time. Hiring an experienced Denver roofing contractor will ensure that your home is protected from all types of weather damage during this time of year.

## Repairing Loose And Removed Shingles

After a storm, it is common to find loose shingles on the roof. This can be caused by the wind or by snow and ice. Shingles can also be dislodged by animals or birds. You may have to remove the shingles and replace them with new ones. You can do this yourself or hire a professional to do the work for you.

## Restoring The Roof From Water Damage

If water has entered your roof, you will want to restore it as soon as possible. Water can cause structural damage to the roof that can lead to leaks and mold on the roof. Water damage will also lead to a loss of insulation on the roof and cause mold and mildew to grow. If your roof has [sustained water damage](https://www.caandesign.com/4-tips-on-handling-water-damage-restoration-projects/){data-affiliate="691"}, you will want to restore it as soon as possible.

## Repairing Leaks In The Roof

If your roof has sustained water damage from a storm, you will want to repair any leaks in the roof immediately. The longer you wait to repair leaks in the roof, the more likely you are to develop leaks in other areas of the roof that can cause more damage. Leaks can also cause mold and mildew growth on the roof. If you are having trouble locating leaks in your roof, you can hire a skilled roofing contractor.

## Damage From Ice And Icicles

Ice can cause damage to your roof if it is not removed quickly enough. One of the most common problems with ice is that it can cause leaks in your roof. If ice has damaged your roof, you will want to have repairs done immediately. Ice storms can cause water damage to your roof, and if left untreated, this water damage can lead to leaks in the roof.

## Restoring A Roof After Snow Damage

If your roof has sustained snow damage from a storm, you will want to restore it as soon as possible. Snow damage on your roof can be caused by wind or by snow and ice. The longer you wait to repair snow damage on your roof, the more likely you are to have problems with leaks in your roof. Snow damage on your roof can also lead to mold and mildew growth on your roof and loss of insulation on the roof. If you are having trouble locating snow damage on your roof, you can hire a skilled contractor to do the work for you.

## Wind Damage To The Roof

If you have a wind-damaged roof, you will want to have repairs done immediately. Wind-damaged roofs can cause leaks in your roof, loss of insulation on your roof, and [mold and mildew growth](https://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infxtra/infroo.html){data-affiliate="692"} on your roof. If your roof has sustained wind damage, you will want to restore it as soon as possible. You should also seek professional help if possible for repairs if your wind-damaged roof has caused leaks in your home.

*After a storm, it is common for roofs to sustain damage from snow, ice, and wind. If a storm causes snow damage or ice damage on your roof, you will want to have repairs done as soon as possible. You will also want to restore your roof as quickly as possible after a storm if water has entered your home or if snow has damaged your roof. Be sure to contact a professional if the damage caused by snow or ice is severe or if there are signs of leaks in your home.*
