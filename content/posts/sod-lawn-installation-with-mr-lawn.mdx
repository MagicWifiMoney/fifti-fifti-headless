Lawns are an integral component of the American landscape. Not only are they visually pleasing, they provide cooling relief and help prevent erosion. Unfortunately, however, maintaining lawns requires significant amounts of water and chemicals.

Discover your lawn installation options, as well as their costs compared to initial and ongoing costs of maintenance. Hand seeding, hydro seeding and sod are three common choices compared to hand sowing or sod.

[Green Lawn Care Boise](https://www.greenlawncareinc.com/){data-affiliate="2944"} suggests hand seeding or hydro seeding as more eco-friendly and cost-effective alternatives to sod installation for your lawn. These methods can be more budget-friendly and sustainable over time, considering the environmental impact and ongoing maintenance costs.

## Cost

Seeding, sodding or hydro seeding a lawn requires several considerations when determining

costs. First and foremost is choosing your type of grass; size and shape also play a factor. You can learn more about [types of grass here](https://ag.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/selection-of-grasses){data-affiliate="1473"}. In addition, cost-cutting measures could include renting equipment such as tape measures, shovels and wheelbarrows from landscape companies.

Sod is an efficient way to create a lush, beautiful lawn. Sod prices vary according to the type of grass being laid down in an area and whether or not a professional sod contractor will install it for you. Although you could save money by installing sod yourself, doing it requires special skills and equipment for seamless coverage that may avoid seams in coverage.

Alternatively, planting grass from seeds is another cost-cutting measure you can take if you want to save money. While it takes longer for the yard to fully develop than sodding does, planting your own can still save money in terms of cost if you have plenty of spare time and are patient with its development.

As you select the type of grass for your lawn, keep in mind that different varieties are more suited to certain climates than others. Cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass and tall fescue tend to thrive in cooler environments while warm-season varieties such as centipede grass, St Augustine grass and zoysia grass perform better in hotter regions.

Your yard's size and shape will also have an effect on its cost of installation. Irregularly-shaped lawns are more costly due to requiring extra time cutting around curves by sod layers. Furthermore, any obstructions like trees and pathways will add additional costs during installation.

## Preparation

Success or failure for any lawn can depend on its site and soil preparation, with improper preparation leading to drainage, compaction, nutrient imbalances and pH changes in later years. 

Therefore, prior to sodding new sod it is vital that all debris, old turf and weeds be cleared away to reduce competition for water and nutrients during establishment; furthermore the site and soil should be aerated to improve moisture retention thereby minimising weed intrusion while encouraging healthy root development and root structure growth.

Soil preparation involves adding organic matter and sand to the topsoil, which help the soil retain moisture more effectively, thus decreasing frequency and duration of watering sessions. You can learn more about [common soil deficiencies here](https://www.rhs.org.uk/prevention-protection/nutrient-deficiencies){data-affiliate="1474"}.  

A soil test kit is also an invaluable resource as it will identify areas lacking fertilizers or amendments so you can address those deficiencies directly.

Before installing sod, it's best to rake the area and remove all rocks, sticks and construction debris to create an even surface for sod to adhere to. Soil should also be aerated in order to minimize compaction of soil; additionally, trenching for sprinkler systems is usually advisable prior to sod installation.

After you have prepared the soil, roll it to form a firm base for sod. Fill a lawn roller one-third full with pressure applied through an application of pressure against the ground in order to avoid slippage. Finally, water the area to an approximate depth of 6 to 8 inches after rolling and watering until firm soil conditions exist again.

Start sod lying by finding a straight edge in the yard (such as a fence or patio). Unroll the first row of sod along this straight edge, making sure there are no air pockets between each piece and making any necessary cuts as needed for curves in your yard. When installing sod on slopes, ensure proper drainage by grading soil accordingly and matching existing features like sidewalks or driveways in height and thickness.

## Installation

Installing a new lawn can [add curb appeal](https://fifti-fifti.net/exterior/5-tips-to-improve-your-homes-curb-appeal/){data-affiliate="1475"} and transform the look of your property, but its installation process may prove challenging for those unfamiliar with its processes.

Selecting a sod installation specialist is crucial to getting the best result from their service. A specialized [lawn installation company](https://mrlawn.ca/'){data-affiliate="1476"} will have more experience and tools necessary for their task than an unspecialized contractor will. This means they will more likely deliver superior results than unspecialized contractors. 

When searching for sod companies online or through referrals from friends or family, look for those that boast established websites, established word-of-mouth recommendations and online reviews; take note of how long they've been operating as well as any negative or positive comments online about them.

Once you have chosen a company, they will come out to prepare the soil and install your sod. This step is essential, as improper preparation could cause failure of sod lying. 

## Maintenance

No matter if it is your first lawn or an existing one that requires attention, proper maintenance is critical for its long-term success. To safeguard your investment and preserve its long-term success, regular [lawn care](https://fifti-fifti.net/landscaping/8-essential-winter-lawn-care-tips/){data-affiliate="1477"} should become part of your everyday routine. 

Address any damage immediately as that could be more expensive in the long run than preventive measures taken beforehand.

A healthy lawn requires adequate moisture, nutrients and air; to provide it, amend the soil accordingly. If you're unsure how to do this yourself, consult a landscape professional or take steps independently to amend it yourself. 

Once your lawn is established, regular [pest prevention and fungicide treatments](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawncare/comments/njwiat/a_list_of_most_lawn_diseases_with_pictures_how_to/){data-affiliate="1478"} should be carried out to keep it free of insects and fungus. Many home and garden stores sell insecticides and fungicides; be sure to read labels carefully before applying these to your grass.

A professional lawn installation company will be able to give you care guidelines to help you keep your lawn healthy. Many also offer maintenance services to make this process simpler for you.
