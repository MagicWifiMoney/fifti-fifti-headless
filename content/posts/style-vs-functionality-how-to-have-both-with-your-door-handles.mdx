Every detail counts as far as our choice of aesthetic appeal and functionality in our living spaces is concerned, and the handles on our doors are no exception. These small yet significant components can significantly impact the overall look and feel of a room. 

However, the choice between style and functionality when it comes to door handles is not necessarily an either-or decision. 

You can have both by considering some key factors in your selection that let you strike the right balance of style and [practicality](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Door){data-affiliate="1178"}. 

## **Consider Your Home's Style**

The first thing you’ll want to consider is to consider the overall style of your home. Your choice should harmonize with your existing decor, whether your home has that traditional feel or embraces a more contemporary, minimalist design.

If you have a traditional home with timeless elements, opt for door handles that boast classic designs. Think about the enduring appeal of brass knobs or lever handles. Their vintage feel can easily blend into your traditional decor, adding a touch of elegance to your doors.

On the other hand, if you reside in a modern abode with clean lines and sleek aesthetics, minimalist [door handles](https://www.doordigest.com/door-handles/){data-affiliate="1179"} are your go-to choice. Stainless steel lever handles or glass knobs can complement the modernity of your space, exuding an air of sophistication and simplicity.

## **Consider Your Door's Purpose**

While style is undoubtedly essential, you can’t afford to compromise on functionality. Different doors serve different purposes, so consider the door's function when selecting handles. A handle ideal for a bedroom door may not be suitable for your front entrance, which faces more wear and tear.

For frequently used doors like the front entrance, prioritize durability and ease of use. A robust, easy-to-grip handle, such as a brass lever with a large, comfortable handle, not only looks inviting but also withstands the test of time and daily use. Lever handles are also much easier to operate, especially for those with limited mobility or dexterity. 

For interior doors, like those in [bedrooms](https://www.lifehack.org/275341/7-creative-doors-which-will-open-your-mind){data-affiliate="1180"}, you can opt for stylish handles that add personality to your space without being too flashy. A simple yet elegant brass knob may be the perfect choice, adding a touch of sophistication to your private retreat. Decorative knobs could also work well for closets or pantries that see less frequent use. 

## **Explore a Variety of Materials**

When it comes to handle materials, brass, stainless steel, and bronze are perennial favorites for their attractive finishes and resistance to wear and tear. However, other materials like glass, wood, and ceramic can impart a unique style while maintaining solid functionality. 

For example, a glass knob paired with a matching metal accent may add visual interest to a powder room. Just be sure to factor in maintenance needs – some materials require more cleaning or polishing than others to keep their finish looking fresh. 

## **Strike a Balance with Finishes**

Similar to materials, handle finishes allow for abundant creativity while tying into your decor. Popular choices include polished brass, satin nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, and matte black for their clean, sophisticated looks. However, highly reflective or very dark surfaces may show fingerprints more easily. 

Thus, lower-maintenance satin or brushed finishes are often preferable, especially for high-traffic areas. With so many attractive finishes on the market, you're sure to find options that complement your style sensibilities.

## **Choosing Door Handles: Final Thoughts**

Door handles offer an opportunity to reflect your personal design tastes while also serving an important purpose. In general, by considering your home's style, the door's purpose, and the materials and details of the handles, you can strike the perfect balance between style and functionality. With the right door handles, your home will undoubtedly be both inviting and beautiful.
