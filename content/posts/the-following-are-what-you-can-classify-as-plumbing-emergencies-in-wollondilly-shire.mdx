We very much take our plumbing for granted here in Australia and we expect everything to operate without issue when we use them. 

It would be interesting to see your reaction when you turn the knob on your shower and absolutely no water comes out never mind hot water. What about if you flush the toilet and then the contents inside start coming upwards instead of going downwards? If you find yourself in a situation where the water from your shower isn’t going away and is pooling at your feet, what exactly will you do then? 

These are questions that that many Australians ask themselves and many still don’t think that these are emergencies and these are issues that they can fix themselves.

There will come a day when you will run into some kind of plumbing emergency and whether or not something is an emergency is entirely up to the individual or people who live in the property. If you live in a property where there are two bathrooms then if one toilet isn’t functioning properly, it isn’t that big of a deal because everyone can use the other one until it is fixed. For them, this is certainly not a plumbing emergency but if there is only one single bathroom in your house then this is definitely something to be worried about. 

Thankfully you can call on** **[**plumbers in Wollondilly Shire**](https://steinsplumbing.com.au/wollondilly-shire/){data-affiliate="1183"} to come to your rescue and the following are just some other plumbing emergencies that you might experience.

- **The clogged sink or bathtub – **There are two sinks in any Australian home that we use a lot. The first one is in the kitchen and the next one is in the bathroom. If the water will not drain away from either of these then it could be regarded as a plumbing emergency. First of all, you can wash any dishes and secondly, you can’t hope to wash your face or shave first thing in the morning if the sink is blocked.
- **The burst pipe – **In any normal home, this is definitely a plumbing emergency and it is something that has to be fixed quickly because an inordinate amount of water can enter your property in such a short space of time due to the pressure it is under. This occurs quite regularly during really cold times of the year [when water freezes within your pipes](https://fifti-fifti.net/utilities/8-drain-issues-that-require-a-professional-plumbers-help/){data-affiliate="1184"}. You should always make a point of getting your pipes checked at least once a year.
- **There is no hot water – **Rather than call this an emergency, many Australians would say that this is a real catastrophe because no hot water means no showering in the morning before you set off to work. If you have children that need to call a school then this is a major problem for you and if you have to give them the day off as a result then your life is going to be hell. It is especially worrying if it happens on a Saturday evening when you’re getting ready to go out for the night.
- **The washing machine hose is broken – **For many home builders across the country, this is something that could be considered an emergency because if you have a large family then you need to do a wash at least twice a week. If nobody has clean clothes then there are going to be a lot of[ stressed out people living under your roof](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/stress){data-affiliate="1185"}. This means it you have to make your way to the local Laundromat or get out the bowls and start washing things by hand.
- **You have a leaky tap –** Now for many, this is not considered an emergency at all but if you have an ensuite bathroom right beside your bed and there is a tap dripping all night long then it’s going to keep you awake and that’s not good. Without a good night’s sleep, you can perform to your optimum the next day and so your job and your general day-to-day life suffers as a direct result.

These are some of the top emergencies that Australian families experience right across the country and there are more.
