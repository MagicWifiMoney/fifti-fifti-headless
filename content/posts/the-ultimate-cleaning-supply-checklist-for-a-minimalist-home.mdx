Are you tired of returning to a house that’s filled with cluttered rooms and dusty walls? Have no idea how to start removing said clutter?

We hear you. Returning home after a long day’s work is a privilege that’s supposed to feel comfortable; however, dealing with random bits of rubbish everywhere can most definitely detract from that experience.

One effective lifestyle choice that more households are adopting is minimalism. A minimalist lifestyle involves stripping the number of possessions you have to the bare essentials. It’s all about reducing needless distractions—and the costs associated with them.

If you’re trying your hand at the minimalist way of life, it can be tough balancing the impulse of not indulging yourself in needless purchases and spending just enough to perform cleaning duties with no restrictions.

That’s where this article will come in. Read this list to know the sole cleaning supplies you need to have a clean and minimalist home.

Let’s dive right in!

## All-Purpose Cleaning Spray

Removing bacteria, grime, and sticky residue from surfaces can technically be done with a dish soap and water mixture. Still, it’s much better to have a versatile cleaning solution like an all-purpose cleaning spray.

With a versatile cleaning spray, you don’t need to have multiple cleaning solutions (which translates to more waste). Instead, you can just have one that can be used for every part of your house, from your kitchen island to your bathroom walls.

If you want to go the distance, opt for a sustainable cleaning solution. 

There are many effective alternatives to those traditional cleaning solutions (including [DIY solutions](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Natural-Disinfectant){data-affiliate="3235"}), as the latter often have neurotoxicants, carcinogens, and other toxic properties that can harm communities and seep through landfills. 

That said, stronger bleach with the active ingredient sodium hypochlorite is always handy to have with you, especially if you need to clean deep your bathrooms from viruses, bacteria, and all sorts of muck. 

Be sure to pick a cleaning spray that comes with government-certified stamps, like the EPA-certified stamp for Americans. And if you don’t want to do the entirety of the cleanup yourself, consider hiring a specialised [cleaning service with Absolute Domestics](http://www.absolutedomestics.com.au/locations/canberra){data-affiliate="3236"}.

## Rags

Rags are absorbent cloths that make for versatile mess-removers. When mixed with some water and soap, a rag can remove traces of dust and dirt and leave behind a clean, sleek surface.

With its versatility and reusability, rags are must-haves for minimalists. They can help keep various parts of the home polished and spotless, especially when combined with cleaning products or a DIY cleaning solution.

And unlike paper towels (which still has its wide range of functions, mind you) or disinfectant wipes, rags are completely reusable. Just chuck them in a laundry machine, dry them out, and get ready to reuse them again.

## Broom and Dustpan

There’s nothing quite as iconic as the classic broom and dustpan duo in your cleaning supply arsenal. These items work hand-in-hand to sweep off dry debris from the floors, helping you keep your rooms tidy and dust-free.

The great thing about these two tools is that they don’t need to be set up like a bulky vacuum. They don’t even consume anything in the utility bill, making them great for cost-free tidying duties.

They’re portability is another notable aspect. You can bring them in multiple rooms around the house with little to no effort, making daily cleanups easy for you.

So, if you want a straightforward and eco-friendly solution, definitely consider getting a broom and dustpan. They’re simplicity embodies the minimlaist principle, and its functinoality cannot be overstated enough.

## Mop and Bucket

A broom and dustpan work wonders for cleaning dry debris, but what about spillages and stains in the flooring? That’s where a bucket and a mop saves the day.

Just like the broom and dustpan, a mop helps clean a variety of floors, from wooden to tiled. It should be used once a week in high-traffic areas like living rooms and kitchens. 

The degree of versatility a mop offers is valued in minimalist spaces.

Ideally, a mop and bucket set is the one you should be aiming for. This makes cleaning floors and cleaning the mop a streamlined task. It also makes storing the tool much easier for you in the future.

## Scrub Brush

For smaller and narrower areas, a scrub bush can help you remove stubborn stains and grime. This tool has special bristles that can make hard-to-reach nooks easier to access and clean. This makes it an indispensable item for cleaning pipes, tight spaces, and shower doors.

The great thing about this tool is that it’s a fairly lightweight and compact tool. You don’t have to store this tool out in the open—you can fit it snugly into a cleaning tool compartment and pick it up when you most need it.

A scrub brush can help you eliminate tough spots and problem areas around your kitchen and restrooms. You can have one for each space. Be sure to replace them every three months or when they start getting discoloured.

## Feather Duster

For delicate fixtures like windows, shelves, [couches](https://fifti-fifti.net/living-room/how-to-clean-polyester-sofa/){data-affiliate="3237"}, and blinds, a duster is a great ally to help you get rid of dust that manage to accumulate in these spaces.

This lightweight tool can hold dust particles, helping you maintain a pristine home environment that can showcase the beauty of minimalism up front.

The great thing about a duster lies in its immediate utility. You don’t need to wash, plug, or mix disinfectants in the places you intend to dust. Simply swipe it along dust-ridden areas and see your place shine.

That said, regular maintenance and washing is necessary to ensure that this item’s maximum effectiveness.

## Sponge

If you don’t have a dishwasher, a sponge and dish soap are absolute essentials for any household. This item, when paired with the proper dish soap and washing and drying techniques, helps keep your utensils and plates clean, dry, and ready for use.

That said, there are many other types of sponges out there. For instance, for cleaning outdoor furniture, an abrasive sponge can do the trick. For cleaning around the house, a cellulose sponge would do.

Most people following minimalist lifestyles only need sponges for their kitchens. Fortunately, most sponges come with rough surfaces that can help get rid of stubborn food material clinging onto the plate. 

Be sure to replace your sponge once every week or two weeks—or when it starts smelling bad.

## Essential Oils and Diffusers

A minimalist lifestyle may not immediately call for the need of a fragrance, but trust us, the right essential oil can make living in your space a much more pleasurable experience.

There are many types of essential oils that you can put in a diffuser. Lavender promotes a calming effect that can help your mind relax and wind down after a long day. Green, foresty scents like eucalyptus can also help you relax and harness your productivity. 

Finding the right scent is ultimately a personal choice. That said, definitely consider adding it to your minimalist home—it’ll elevate your level of comfort profoundly.
