Preparing your home to move is the best time to start purging. Now is your chance to have a fresh start in your new home without transporting all the junk you have accumulated over the years. 

Any homeowner can tell you that it doesn’t take long to accumulate more stuff than you could ever need. Our closets, garages, and basements are packed full of items that only get used occasionally or not at all. If you are [getting ready to move](https://fifti-fifti.net/uncategorized/9-pro-tips-for-moving-furniture/){data-affiliate="693"}, now is the time to start sorting your things and picking out your essential items. 

Purging your home can be an emotional challenge. We tend to want to hold onto items that spark memories or could possibly have a use one day down the line. Gather up some boxes, decide what to donate or keep and throw the rest out into your rented [40 yard dumpster guide ](https://www.xpressbins.ca/blog/how-big-is-a-40-yard-dumpster/){data-affiliate="694"}to get the job done. Let’s take a look at a few top tips for purging your home before moving. 

## Start Early 

You should [never wait until the last minute](https://timemanagementninja.com/2018/06/10-reasons-not-to-wait-until-the-last-minute-with-deadlines/){data-affiliate="695"} to start the pre-move purging process. While the chore may be an intimidating one, it is also necessary. Give yourself lots of time to complete the process in stages. It’s a good idea to start with one room and move on when it’s done. Areas like your basement and garage may take longer than one day to process. 

## Rent a Dumpster

As you are sorting through your things, you will likely come across a good pile of things headed for the garbage. Instead of filling endless plastic bags, consider renting a dumpster that can be delivered to your property. You can simply throw everything in the dumpster, and once you are finished, the rental company will pick it up and take it away.

## Sorting Bins

When you start the process of purging, it can be challenging to decide what to keep and what has to go. [Setting up a sorting system](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-organize-your-closet-2648411){data-affiliate="696"} can be helpful. Grab a few bins and label them Keep, Toss, and Donate to help you make sense of everything you are packing. If you find that your Keep box is continually full, it’s alright. Put everything aside, and once you are done, you can reconsider the importance of everything that you have put in the Keep box. 

## Focus On the Goal

[Moving](https://fifti-fifti.net/utilities/6-things-to-do-when-moving-into-a-new-house/){data-affiliate="697"} is an expensive endeavor, and even more costly if you need to move many unnecessary items. The process may seem overwhelming, and you may have difficulty staying on task. While it’s undoubtedly fun to go through memorabilia that you uncover during the process, you need to stay focused on minimizing your items. Pack your photo albums away to be enjoyed at your new home and get back to work.

## Letting Go

People often become overly attached to material items that allow them to enjoy their memories. While memorabilia items are essential, it’s crucial to remember that you cherish the memories, not the item itself. If you have difficulty deciding on an item, look at it closely and ask yourself if it is useful, [does it bring you joy](https://anindigoday.com/marie-kondo-method/){data-affiliate="698"}, and if it is practical. If you answer yes, then it’s an important item to keep for your new home. 

*Purging your home before you move to your new home is a great way to simplify the process. Follow these tips to help you prepare for the transition and get rid of the things you don’t need to take to your new home. *
