The ottoman is arguably the most versatile furnishing you can own. Part chair, part coffee table, and part footstool, this handy piece is as much at home in a bathroom or bedroom as it is in a living area. Starting with a basic leather ottoman, here are three tips for incorporating this highly functional item into your space.

## **1. Choose Your Leather Ottoman Wisely**

Not all ottomans are created equal. When you are shopping for the perfect piece, consider these suggestions for finding the perfect ottoman for your needs.

- Choose a [leather ottoman](https://www.polyandbark.com/collections/benches-stools-ottomans){data-affiliate="1058"} for durability and a timeless look that matches nearly everything.
- Select a color that connects the colors of the room; ensure it doesn't clash with other furniture, walls, or floor. [Neutral colors](https://www.housedigest.com/797912/how-to-decorate-an-ottoman/){data-affiliate="1059"} are the most time-honored and will continue to work with your space despite future re-decorating efforts. Your ottoman should blend in naturally, so avoid anything much lighter or darker than your other furniture.
- Pick a shape that complements the dimensions and purpose of your room. Round is most appropriate for informal spaces, and rectangular shapes look great in longer rooms.
- Go with a larger size than you think you will need. Generally speaking, the bigger the leather ottoman, the better it looks in a room. 

## **2. Determine Function**

Your leather ottoman can serve so many purposes, but it can't be everywhere at once. Consider all of the [many possible uses](https://theinspiredroom.net/2022/09/06/ottomans-reasons-to-use-them/){data-affiliate="1060"} before settling on one. Ottomans can provide extra seating in a smaller space. Their softness makes them a safe alternative to coffee tables for homes with toddlers. They can provide a convenient space for changing shoes in a closet or serve as a catch-all space for blankets and throw pillows at the foot of a bed.

## **3. Decorate Your Leather Ottoman**

After your ottoman has been placed and its function determined, you can focus on sprucing it up. There are many ways you can [style an ottoman](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/lessons/ottoman-decor-ideas/){data-affiliate="1061"} to make the biggest impact in a space.

- Add a tray. This is both practical and fashionable. A tray will protect the ottoman while providing a flat surface and defined space for displaying useful and decorative objects, but is easily relocated when you need a seat. Play around with the shape and color of the tray to complement the shape of the ottoman and the colors in your space.
- Stack books. Coffee table books aren't just for coffee tables. Using the widest book as a base, stack a few attractive volumes and top with a vase of fresh flowers.
- Create a bar spot. Using a low-profile tray, you can display functional and beautiful serving pieces, such as glasses, a fancy ice bucket, and a decanter. Just add liquor to give your space a speakeasy vibe.
- Play games. Your leather ottoman provides a versatile space for family fun. Use it for assembling puzzles, playing cards, or displaying an antique chess set. 
- Layer textiles. Draping a fluffy blanket or heirloom quilt over one corner of the ottoman, or piling up a few throw pillows in the center are all great ways to add warmth to the room and display your cherished items.
