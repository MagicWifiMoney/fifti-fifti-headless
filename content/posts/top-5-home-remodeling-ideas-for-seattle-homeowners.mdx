When it comes to undertaking a [home remodeling Seattle](https://www.homecarecontractors.com/home-remodeling/){data-affiliate="1066"} project, you might be curious to know what today’s homeowners are doing to improve their properties. In some cases, they may be improving their houses with the purpose of putting them on the market and wanting to improve the chances of a fast sale at a higher price. In most cases, however, home remodeling projects are done to improve the conditions of the home and the quality of life of those living within it. Whatever the reason, it is always nice to be aware of remodeling trends to get inspiration for a project you may consider now or in the future. Here are some popular ones.

## Spa Bathroom

Nowadays, improving the main [bathroom in such a way](https://fifti-fifti.net/bath/how-to-wash-clean-bathroom-rugs-mats/){data-affiliate="1067"} as to make it look and feel like a spa is something that many homeowners consider the epitome of luxury when they want to spoil themselves. The most desirable feature of a spa bathroom, besides luxurious materials and finishes, is a free-standing deep soaker tub in which they can spend some private time unwinding and pampering themselves. In the shower, you can add steam or a heated towel rack, and over the vanities, you can install lighted mirrors that can help with your makeup. Finish the look with great lighting and a set of plush towels in your favorite color.

## Improved Outdoor Areas

Summer is the ideal time to improve the outdoor deck or patio. Go for a non-slip floor and continue either by adding an inviting [fire pit](https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/backyard-fire-pit-recipes/){data-affiliate="1068"} where you and your guests can enjoy some time together. Or have your contractor install a built-in grill with enough counter area to hold all cooking instruments and seasonings. Add a table with comfortable chairs and some outdoor lighting and you have created an additional living space that can be enjoyed by all.

## Add a Multifunctional Island

Now more than ever it seems as though the kitchen is the preferred place for families to gather. Install a large multifunctional island that can serve as a breakfast bar, a place for the kids to do their homework while they watch you cook, or a dining room table. Customize your multifunctional island by adding features like drawers, shelves, cabinets, outlets, and other additions such as a wine fridge.

## Create Storage Under the Stairs

The space under the stairs is often overlooked. However, if you need more space, you can be creative and use that square footage for a variety of purposes. Knock down any existing walls to liberate the area and get a sense of how large it is. You may decide to turn it into much-needed storage, a coat closet, or to create extra seating. Another idea is to turn this tiny area into an office that will allow you to work from home without you having to clutter the dining room table or kitchen island with work-related paperwork. Install a desk with a comfortable chair and add some shelving or a whiteboard to jot down to-do lists and other urgent tasks. Decorate with bold wallpaper or add an interesting planter in one corner.

## Focus on Curb Appeal

There is nothing that refreshes the look of a house more thoroughly than updating its curb appeal. An appealing look will not only add value to the property but will give you added inspiration to work on other indoor projects later on. Have a look at your siding and decide whether a deep power washing will be enough or if new siding is needed. Paint the front door or change it out and get a model that will make a statement. Look at the driveway and decide if it needs to be refinished and add planters with plentiful bushes and flowers. If needed, get new windows to improve the look of the home even further while providing [energy efficiency](https://www.energystar.gov/about/how_energy_star_protects_environment/energy_efficiency){data-affiliate="1069"} at the same time.

## Other Remodeling Ideas

There are always plenty of ideas to carry out a home remodeling project in Seattle. You can remove the old carpeting and have new wood flooring installed, or look at the lighting in your home and if there are any dark areas or corners, add the appropriate lamps or chandeliers.
