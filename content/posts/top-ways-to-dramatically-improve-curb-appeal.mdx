Having decided to dedicate your time and energy to improving the aesthetic appeal of the exterior of your home, before you get outside, don your gardening gloves, and get to work, it would be helpful to make yourself aware of the most important elements upon which to concentrate.

With that being said, read on to learn of the four top ways to dramatically improve the curb appeal of your property. 

## 1. **Paint the Front Door**

One of the cheapest ways to transform the first impression guests and potential viewers alike feel when they approach your property is to choose a bright and clean new color and [repaint your front door](https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/home-improvement/painting/how-to-paint-front-door){data-affiliate="1878"}.

For wooden front doors, a wood stain is an excellent choice, which will help the door last longer and also provide a fresh new sheen to the wood. and if you instead are looking for more color to the outside of your property, choose dark green, subtle red or even the traditional navy blue. 

## 2. **Keep Your Trash Cans Out of Sight **

Obviously, during an average week when nothing exciting is happening and you either know you have no home viewings by potential buyers that week, or else no loved ones are popping over, keeping the trash cans near the front of your home is normal and perfectly acceptable.

When concentrating on improving the curb appeal of the property, however, hiding the garbage bins out of sight will instantly elevate the appearance and first impressions of your home for the better.

## 3. **Add Edging to the Lawn & Flower Beds **

When a prospective buyer, or else a loved one who is staying with you over the holidays, takes a look around your garden and backyard, the presence of strong, [sturdy and attractive steel garden edging](https://www.legacyedging.co.uk/product-category/mild-steel/){data-affiliate="1879"} will give the impression that you are a regular and dedicated gardener (even if you are, in reality, far from it). 

Wonderfully, there are a host of advantages to finishing off your flower beds, cornering off your herb [garden](https://fifti-fifti.net/landscaping/low-maintenance-garden-ideas-for-effortless-beauty/){data-affiliate="1880"}, and keeping the grass from the lawn off the paving slabs by installing affordable metal edging, not least the little-to-no maintenance time required once in position. 

In addition, should you be becoming sick and tired of constantly having to mow the front and back grass in your gardens, you could also consider spending a bit of money and having the gardens graveled or tarmacked instead. 

## 4. **Clear Out the Gutters**

Especially during the more extreme and often, downright unpredictable, weather of the winter months and during storms and high winds, the number of dry leaves, dirt, and other random pieces of debris tend to gather inside the guttering around the building.

Not only will hiring a professional to give the whole system a good clean mean that you are less likely to encounter problems with the plumbing system, but you can also rest assured that the finished effect will [vastly improve for first-time visitor](https://www.ronseal.com/inspiration/13-tips-to-improve-the-kerb-appeal-of-your-home/){data-affiliate="1881"}s and regular ones alike.
