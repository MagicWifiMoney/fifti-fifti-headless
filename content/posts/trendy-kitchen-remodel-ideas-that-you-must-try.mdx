Designing a functional and updated kitchen is crucial to maintaining and increasing the value of your home. While renovating a kitchen can be an expensive treat, one can always jump onto trendy kitchen remodel ideas to upgrade their kitchen without breaking the bank. 

If you are a decor enthusiast and want to give your kitchen a makeover, read the full article to know the top five trending remodel ideas you can try. 

## Choose Colored Kitchen Cabinets

All-white has gone out of fashion. It's an era of colored walls, colored furniture, and colored cabinets. Every second house in America has decorated its kitchen space with trendy and unique cabinets. 

The average cost of kitchen cabinets would cost you anywhere from $75 to $400, and custom colored cabinets can be costlier. While you would love to do your own research, contacting [Kitchen Renovation Contractors](https://homerenodirect.com/services/kitchen-renovation/){data-affiliate="440"} to update your kitchen cabinets would be a smart choice; suggest experts. However, if your cabinets are structurally sound, you can upgrade them by incorporating the following tips: 

- Deep clean your cabinets as collected dust and grime can make them look dull and old.
- Cabinet doors often lose their hinges and shine with time; you can choose to replace the doors with new ones. This would just cost you a fraction of the price and, in return, will give you a new look. 
- Another quick and creative way to upgrade your cabinets is by refreshing them with a coat of paint ([consider turquoise](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/turquoise-kitchen-decor/){data-affiliate="441"}). Go for neutrals or trendy color options, ensuring that they complement your flooring and the color of the walls. 

## Update the Sink Faucet

Swapping an old faucet with a new one is a quick, easy, and cost-effective way to upgrade your kitchen. It will change the entire look of your sink, especially if the grout and cabinets are placed well. If you have good DIY skills, you can think about replacing the faucet by yourself. 

However, most people generally call a plumber to fix the new faucet to avoid any sort of carelessness. Professional-style faucets with smart features of hand-free water structure are more in trend. 

## Install a Backsplash 

Backsplashes make one of the most attractive and functional additions to your kitchen space. Not only do they protect the walls, countertops, and behind the stove area, but they also add beauty and interest to your home. 

While there are various types of backsplashes, some of the trending ones include subway tiles, bold patterns, and mirror tiles. Ceramic tile, porcelain tile, glass tile, stone tile, and peel-and-stick tile are a few of the other popular options.

## Go For Trendy Kitchen Hardware 

Another quick and creative way to remodel your kitchen is to update the hardware. It is as simple as replacing builder-grade knobs and drawer pulls with something vintage style. Vintage is always the most classic and safest option to go with. 

And the best thing is that the hardware doesn't necessarily need to be synced with your kitchen flooring or cabinets. As long as you're choosing common hardware options, such as brass pulls with black appliances, it will add visual interest to your overall kitchen design. Moreover, pick hardware that is easy to clean and complements the old hardware's drill length. This enables fast installation. 

## Go for Wood Kitchen Flooring

Many homeowners believe wood to be an ultra-desirable flooring choice due to its appealing warmth, natural beauty, and durability. Though many objects to [wood kitchen flooring](https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/kitchen-remodel/hardwood-flooring-in-the-kitchen){data-affiliate="442"} being an inappropriate option for summers, wood flooring works perfectly fine if you have an air-conditioned home. 

If you prefer a house environment that has a casual and relaxed vibe, wood kitchen flooring might be a great option. Consider a matt finish as it's said to be more forgiving and promotes comfort. 

And it's easy to clean and maintain wood floors with a clean and damp mop. Also, make sure that you immediately wipe off any water on the surface. Plus, wood flooring has a beautiful look that can enhance the overall look of your house. 

## Install Smart Kitchen Appliances

 A major percentage of American households have their kitchen installed with kitchen appliances. These smart appliances allow you to control the chores with just the click of an app. And considering the rising scope of electricity, these appliances will be in every household in the next few years. Some of the latest and trending kitchen appliances include instant pot smart wifi, purifying heater+fan, and multifunctional digital air fryer. 

Smart appliances can also help you [keep things organized and tidy](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/how-to-organize-a-small-kitchen-with-no-pantry/){data-affiliate="443"}.
