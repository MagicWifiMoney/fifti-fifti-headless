If your current house lacks some space, and if you’re finding it difficult to function for that matter, or if you would simply like to have some more space even though you may not exactly need it, what you should start thinking about is how to make things happen without actually building a new home from scratch. After all, demolishing your current property and building a new one will take time, and you probably don’t want to do that for other reasons as well. You may be quite happy with your home most of the times, but you simply feel that some additional space could come in handy.

Here is what you need to know if you want to [extend your home](http://Here%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know%20if%20you%20want%20to%20extend%20your%20home:%20https://www.openagent.com.au/blog/home-extensions-101-what-you-need-to-know){data-affiliate="1719"}. 

As you may have guessed it, then the right thing to do when aiming at getting extra space is go for house extensions. Since you won’t be building an entirely new home, you will have a much easier time going through the entire process. And, you will get great end results. That is, you will get the space that you have been looking for, regardless of what kind of space we are actually talking about. There are different types of extensions, as we will see a bit later.

Now, apart from simply wanting extra space, you may want to undertake extensions in case of some changes in the family circumstances. For example, the arrival of new children may get you familiar with the fact that you need extra space. Or, the departure of your children to college, for instance, could be a catalyst for [making some renovations](https://fifti-fifti.net/renovations/13-value-adding-renovations-to-undertake-this-year/){data-affiliate="1720"}. Then, if you’ve just become a new owner of a property, you may also want to do those renovations and create more space for yourself.

## **Unlocking More Space: House Extensions for Your Home**

So, if you have been thinking about how to get more space at home, extensions are what you should focus on. Sure, you could always search for some design tips that could make the place visually bigger, such as adding mirrors to small rooms, but that is not exactly a permanent solution, nor a functional one. You need to really unlock more space, and you will be able to do that with house extensions. Get some ideas on those [here](https://www.houzz.com.au/photos/sunroom-design-photos-phbr0-bp~t_12309){data-affiliate="1721"}.

If you’ve been reading carefully above, then you have understood the reasons why these extensions are done. From simply wanting to invest your money into your property and get more space while you’re at it, to actually needing the extra space because you have a child on the way, numerous reasons exist why people do this. And, they are all quite justified. What you may be wondering, though, is how you can do it the right way.

Well, let me begin by making one thing perfectly clear. This is not a project that you should undergo alone. Not only because you don’t have the right sets of skills or the right equipment to help you achieve your goals and do the actual renovations, but also because you may not be aware of the codes and the regulations that should be followed during the renovations and during the process of adding the extensions. So, doing things alone, without knowing those important things, can easily lead to you making some wrong moves and thus being unhappy with the work you’ve done, or perhaps having to pay some fines due to not following the regulations.

Since the above things don’t really sound like favorable scenarios, I am quite sure you would much rather do the right thing. And, the right thing, of course, consists of hiring professionals to complete the house extension project for you and thus unlock more space in your home, which is precisely what you want. The only thing is, of course, you’ll need to be quite careful in the hiring process, aiming at choosing those experts that are not only experienced, but also quite reputable on the market and that will, therefore, do a great job for you. Remember the costs as well and compare them, with the goal of finding the most reasonable solution and being happy about it.

## From Sunrooms to Second Stories

There is one thing to do, though, before proceeding towards hiring those pros and having them unlock more space at your home. While choosing a great [house extension builder](https://www.lucidbac.com.au/service/house-extensions-central-coast){data-affiliate="1722"} is of utmost importance, it is also highly significant for you to determine precisely what you want to do and which extensions you would actually like to have done at the property. You can’t do that, however, if you’re not familiar with at least a few important types.

From sunrooms to second stories, the professionals you’ll hire will be able to do it all for you. That is, of course, as long as you know what you want to have done. You may, for example, want to connect the indoor and the outdoor space more successfully, which could call for the building of a veranda or an outdoor living area.

Additionally, you may need extra space for your vehicles, meaning you may need to build a garage. In fact, even if you don’t really need it for the vehicle, this can be a great addition to your home, as it will provide you with extra storage space. So, choose where you want to have the garage built around the house and let the professionals handle the rest.

## Conclusion

Apart from all of that, you can build an additional bedroom, an extra bathroom, a sunroom, a whole second story, or even a pool if you feel like it. All of these extensions will, of course, cost a different amount of money, which is why you first need to decide on your budget and figure out how much you are actually ready to spend. Once that is done, you will also have to compare the costs offered by different house extension builders in your area, as they are bound to give you different quotes as well, and you want to choose those professionals that will offer reasonable ones.
