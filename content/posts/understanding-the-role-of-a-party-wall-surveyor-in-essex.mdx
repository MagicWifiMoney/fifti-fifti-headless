Most people don’t know about party wall surveyors. However, they play a vital role in construction projects. Building walls separating properties or office spaces may look easy on paper, but there’s a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes.

If you plan to build a wall to separate your property from your neighbor, you must hire a party wall surveyor. In this article, we delve into the responsibilities, qualifications, and importance of party wall surveyors. Also included in this guide are tips to consider when hiring a party wall surveyor in Essex.

## **The Basics of Party Wall Surveying**

Before we go into the roles that party wall surveyors play, it is crucial to understand the basics. A party wall is a shared wall between two properties. Party walls can also be used to separate office spaces in apartments.

In many cases, especially those involving an [architecture practice](https://www.epadesign.co.uk/){data-affiliate="4376"}, neighbors are required by law to hire a party wall surveyor during this process. Party wall surveyors follow regulations stipulated in the 1996 Party Wall Act. The Act helps prevent and resolve disputes between property owners arising from construction work that may affect shared walls.

Party wall surveyors will use the Act to create an agreement and communication framework between involved parties.

## **The Role of a Party Wall Surveyor**

Parties sharing a boundary are required by law to hire a party wall surveyor before erecting a wall to share their properties. A party wall surveyor will issue party wall notices to neighboring property owners.&nbsp;

The party wall notice informs the neighbor about impending construction works. It will include everything like all of the work that will be done before and after the wall is built. Also included will be areas that the workers can access when building the wall. This notice gives your neighbor a chance to voice their concerns before construction begins.&nbsp;

Besides drafting party wall notices, surveyors also conduct negotiation meetings between two parties. The goal is to use mediation and arbitration rather than taking party wall cases to court. Party wall surveyors are required to be impartial and follow the rule of law as stipulated in the Party Wall Act. The surveyors also have experience in property and construction law, which helps them navigate complex issues while ensuring that the rights and concerns of the parties involved are addressed.

Party wall surveyors in Essex also double up as project managers. They are responsible for inspecting the ongoing project to ensure that it follows the agreed-upon party wall award. Inspection jobs will involve regular site visits and assessing and addressing any emerging issues.

The surveyor will also draft an award after the project is done as a report for future reference. The documentation serves as a crucial reference point in the event of a dispute or claim for damages.

## **Qualifications and Expertise of Party Wall Surveyors&nbsp;**

Party wall surveyors are licensed professionals with specialized knowledge and training in party wall matters. They are also members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which ensures that they hold high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct.

As mentioned, party wall surveyors are conversant with property law, particularly the 1996 Party Wall Act. This expertise is what helps them draft party wall notices, mediate disputes between neighbors sharing boundaries, and guide property owners through the process of building and maintaining shared walls.

## **Key Considerations When Hiring a Party Wall Surveyor in Essex**

If you are planning to build a shared wall, it's crucial to navigate the legal and structural aspects as required by law. Hiring the right surveyor is essential to make the process smooth and maintain good relations with your neighbors.

Ensure that the party wall surveyor is qualified and licensed. You can search for membership on the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors list. Presence on the list is a commitment to high professional standards and ongoing education.

Ask for references from friends who have built shared walls. If you are in Essex, you can find professional and experienced surveyors from [HumphreysandSons](https://www.humphreysandsons.co.uk/party-wall-act){data-affiliate="1430"}. Feedback from others who have worked with the surveyor can provide valuable insights into their work. It will also cut down the time needed to search for and hire a competent party wall surveyor.

The next thing is years of experience in the field. Party wall issues and disagreements can be complex and sensitive matters. Choose a surveyor with a proven track record in handling party wall matters. Experienced professionals have come across different scenarios and can address potential issues well.

We also recommend hiring a party wall surveyor from your state or town. Surveyors from your town are familiar with local regulations and construction practices. Local property laws are crucial when solving issues related to shared walls and boundaries.&nbsp;

Ensure that the party wall surveyor has professional indemnity insurance. To err is human, and professionals can make mistakes when drafting party wall notices. The insurance will cover both parties in case of any errors or omissions made by the surveyor during the process. It will protect you and your neighbor from extra expenses should there be a need to edit the party wall notice agreement.

Also, consider and discuss the fee structure before hiring a party wall surveyor in Essex. Agree with the surveyor on all fees and additional fees before signing the agreement. Transparent agreements will prevent any misunderstandings or disputes over fees later in the process. Charges may vary depending on the size of the project and the parties involved.&nbsp;

Communication and customer service are also crucial factors that you must consider. Construction projects can be hectic, and poor communication and customer service will make things even more complex. Delays in timelines can increase costs and destroy relationships with your neighbors.&nbsp;

## **Summing Up**

Building a shared wall is no mean feat and shouldn't be done without following the proper channels. Hiring a party wall surveyor is a critical step in ensuring the success of your construction or renovation project while maintaining positive relationships with your neighbors.

A party wall surveyor will help you draft a legal party wall notice. The professional will also mediate and provide impartial solutions should disagreements arise later after the wall has been built.&nbsp;

Ensure that you hire a competent professional who understands local property laws well.
