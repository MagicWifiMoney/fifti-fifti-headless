Water is a basic need for each home, but it's not about just having water in your home; it's also about having clean water free from any contaminants. Without that, the risk of contracting a disease or another through your water source remains high. 

To stay safe, [a water filtration system](https://www.completehomefiltration.com.au/your-health/){data-affiliate="333"} will be an important addition to your home’s water system. But, before you even get to trying to find out [how to save on your filter](https://www.filtap.com.au/purified-water-sydney-get-affordable-solutions/){data-affiliate="334"}, it's a good idea to start by understanding water filters and take note of a few tips to help you make the best buy. 

There are many different types of filters available on the market today. Some of the most prominent ones are carbon block, reverse osmosis (RO), and distillers. These various options can be confusing and overwhelming if you're clueless about filters. This article can help you choose the right water filter for your particular needs.

## Types Of Water Filters To Choose From

In more detail, here are the types of filters you'll need to choose from: 

### Carbon Block

These remove various contaminants, including pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and medical waste chemicals. It can also remove pollutants like arsenic, lead, radon, and mercury. Carbon block filters also reduce most, if not all, of the bad taste and odor created by [tap water](https://justwater.com/blogs/news/water-wars-tap-vs-mineral-water){data-affiliate="335"}. Carbon block filters come in two varieties; under-sink (under-counter) and refrigerator compatible. These varieties are completely customizable to fit with your [kitchen décor](https://fifti-fifti.net/kitchen/how-to-decorate-your-kitchen/){data-affiliate="336"}.

### Reverse** Osmosis**

Water passed through a reverse osmosis membrane is very low in mineral content. Reverse osmosis systems are typically installed underneath your sink or next to the kitchen sink.There is one main unit that houses both the RO system and storage tank.

However, there are also smaller jug-type units that can be placed on top of your kitchen counter for easy dispensing. Many buyers purchase their RO systems with separate storage tanks so they can store filtered water in different locations in their homes. The biggest advantage of a reverse osmosis system is that it removes many contaminants, making the water taste clean and fresh.

### Distillers

Just as the name suggests, distillers produce distilled water from tap water through vaporization and condensation. The amount of contaminants remaining in the distilled water is almost non-existent compared to standard tap or filtered water. The only downfall is that distillers take up more space than other filtration systems since there are multiple components.

## Understand POE And POU

No matter which type, your water filter can either be a point of entry or a point of use. Point-of-Entry (POE) means that the entire dwelling's water supply will be filtered, often installed at the street or well before it enters your home.

Point-of-Use (POU) refers to a single faucet in the house being equipped with its filter system, also called an "under counter" unit. Both of these filtration systems can remove chlorine and most organic contaminants, which reduces bad taste and odor issues associated with poor quality tap water.****

### Investigate What Is In Your Water

Before you invest in a filtration system, see what's actually in your tap water. You can have it tested at a reputable laboratory to find out which contaminants are present. This will help you choose the best filtering technology for your home. For example, suppose high levels of lead or mercury are present in the water supply due to corrosion of old household plumbing systems. In that case, reverse osmosis may be desirable over activated carbon.

### Know** The Flow Rate of Your Dispensers and Appliances**

The flow rate of a water filter system is an important factor to consider. It's the speed at which the water passes through filters as it enters or leaves your home. The faster the water flows, the more contaminants will pass through the filtering process and into your drinking water. If you have a high flow rate in your pipes, this may restrict a filter unit's effectiveness.

### Purpose Of Filtration

Water filtration can provide much-needed protection against common tap water contaminants. However, don't expect any filtration system to provide 100 percent protection against all possible contaminants.

### Maintain The Effectiveness Of The Filter

Some purification systems rely on activated carbon and ion-exchange resins to remove impurities from tap water. It is important to replace these filters when necessary because they lose their ability to cleanse water over time.

### Supplier And Manufacturer Credibility

Choose a reputable dealer that has been in business for at least 10 years and offers at least some customer support after you purchase an item (such as online chat or toll-free phone numbers). A good company may offer discounts on replacement filters, provide affordable financing options, and honor warranties.

## Find a Water Filter That Works for You

Millions of [liters of water](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalieparletta/2019/04/11/illuminating-water-filtration-could-reduce-the-energy-cost-of-desalination/){data-affiliate="337"} get filtered daily, and you can help add this volume. The most important thing is to find the water filter that works best for your particular needs. This can be difficult because many factors go into choosing a good system, including price points and environmental impact.
