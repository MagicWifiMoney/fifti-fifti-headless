Wind, rain, hail, snow – the list of what weather can throw at your home is almost endless, and while the external walls of your property can usually take it, your windows are another story. This doesn’t mean you have to worry about the glass so much, but the frame? If your windows are older, the seals aren’t holding up, or a number of other issues, water, ice, dirt, and more can get into the tiny cracks and cause further damage. 

The good news is that there are many ways to fix these issues if you start to spot them. Some of them are preventative, others restorative, and others still work not just to protect your windows and doors, but also to add some great detailing to your home: 

## 1. **Add a Canopy **

Adding a canopy is one of the top preventative steps you can take, especially for French doors or glass doors and windows. Adding [a suitable canopy](http://www.fibreglassmouldings.co.uk/patio-canopies-roofs.asp){data-affiliate="1890"} protects the top of your windows (especially doors) from water and wind damage, which has a trickle-down effect towards protecting the rest of the area. As a bonus, adding such canopies allows you to enhance the design of your property, and protects you from immediate rain if you open the door or window. 

## 2. **Add Shutters **

Shutters are the classic way to protect your windows from damage, and can be installed outside of your home (known as storm shutters). These are best suited for properties near the seaside, and where there’s a risk that a tree or other similar item might break and fall into your window. This way, if there’s a storm coming, you can seal your windows from the outside to best protect them. 

## 3. **Seal Cracks **

Once a year, it’s a good idea to go around the exterior of your home and [check for cracks](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/home-insurance/cracks/){data-affiliate="1891"}, especially around your windows and doors. This tip does not work for any crack near your foundation, just in the windows or seals themselves. If there is an issue, seal it up quickly. If the issue is with the caulk, remove it and reapply. If it’s the weatherstrip, you’ll need to replace it. 

## 4. **Replace the Weatherstripping **

If the weatherstripping is cracked, falling off, or missing chunks, then it’s important to replace it. Weatherstrip tape is a foam tape that seals out moisture, which can lead to rot and damp. If the fix isn’t easy, of course, then bring on a professional to ensure that the problem is handled from the inside-out. 

## 5. **Replace the Window **

If the window or door is just too far gone, then the only thing you can do to protect your home from damp and draft is to have the trim replaced, if not the entire window/door. The good news, if you do have to do a full refit, is that you can [upgrade your windows](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/windows-and-doors/){data-affiliate="1892"} and increase the insulation around your windows to help you save on utility costs in the future. If you are on a budget, of course, take it window by window, starting with the windows that get the most action during inclement weather.
