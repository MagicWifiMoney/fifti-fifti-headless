As a business owner, ensuring your company achieves sustained, long-term success should be your number one priority. There are various ways to go about this, it could be through developing your product line, hiring new staff, or implementing a new marketing strategy. 

We’re seeing an increase in the use and popularity of [business storage](https://www.safestore.co.uk/business-storage/storage-lockups/){data-affiliate="1081"} lockups in the UK. Why is this? Can they be used by business owners to improve their companies? Keep reading to find out. 

## What Are Business Storage Lockups?

A storage lockup is an external space that be hired and used to store all manner of items. They are commonly used by individuals and can be used to house anything including spare furniture, vehicles, decorations, or hobby supplies. 

Business storage is simply the term used to describe external storage units that are hired and used by businesses, rather than individuals or members of the public. Business storage units can come in a range of different types and sizes but are generally larger than standard units, given that they are often used to house professional equipment or a large volume of materials. 

Why would a business use an external storage unit? Why are they becoming more popular in the UK? Let’s find out. 

## Declutter Your Office

If you are a business owner with an office, you’ll be well aware of how quickly things can become messy and disorganised. Even a small office with a limited number of staff can descend into chaos before you’ve realised. Boxes of documents, spare computer parts, extra chairs, all of these things can accumulate over time in your office and make it look cluttered and unappealing. 

First and foremost, this can have an affect on your staff. Working in a messy office can demotivate your employees and [negatively impact their performance](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-case-for-finally-cleaning-your-desk){data-affiliate="1082"}. Furthermore, if you are inviting clients back for meetings in your office, the sight of mess and clutter can make them rethink their decision to do business with you.  

By renting out an external storage unit, businesses can instantly remove the clutter in their office and create a clean, organised space for employees to work in. This will help [boost employee productivity](https://www.healthworkscollective.com/health-benefits-of-a-clean-office/){data-affiliate="1083"} and will make your office an attractive space to bring clients into. 

Sometimes you might not have time to sort through all the clutter and decide what can be thrown out and what needs to be kept, so storing it all in an external unit can keep it out of the way until you have the time to properly assess it. 

## Moving Offices

As a business scales and grows, moving to a bigger office is a natural step. However, this can be a complicated process that can cause serious disruption to a company. The most effective way to approach an office move is to do so gradually. By renting business storage, you can begin moving surplus equipment out of the office ahead of time. This will significantly simplify the moving process and will mean you don’t have to move everything at once. 

Your office move should be symbolic of your company’s growth and success, the last thing you want is for it to end up damaging your business. By renting an external unit you can ensure the moving process is as straightforward and disruption free as possible. 

## Consider Business Storage Lockups

It’s easy to see why business storage is becoming more and more popular in the UK. If your office needs a refresh and a serious tidy up, or if you’re planning to scale your company and move to a larger premises, business storage could be just the thing you’re looking for.
