Mixer grinders are essential kitchen appliances widely used for various tasks, including grinding, blending, and mixing. One of the essential components of a mixer grinder is the jars that come with it. The mixer grinder jars come in different sizes, shapes, and materials, each designed to perform specific functions. And together, they form essential [mixer parts](https://www.elgiultra.com/us/products/spare-parts.html){data-affiliate="919"}. This article will discuss the three jars that usually come with a mixer grinder and their uses.

## **Jar 1: Grinding Jar**

The grinding jar is the most commonly used in a mixer grinder. It grins dry ingredients like spices, lentils, and rice into fine powders. The grinding jar is usually made of stainless steel or polycarbonate material, which is durable and long-lasting. It has sharp blades that can efficiently grind even the toughest ingredients in seconds.

The grinding jar usually comes in a small or medium size, depending on the mixer grinder's capacity. The small grinding jar has a capacity of 0.5-0.75 liters, while the medium-sized jar can hold up to 1-1.5 liters of ingredients. The jar's lid usually has a locking mechanism that ensures the contents do not spill out during grinding.

When using the grinding jar, it is vital to ensure that the ingredients are dry and moisture-free. Moisture can cause the ingredients to clump together, making it difficult for the blades to grind them evenly. It is also recommended to pulse the mixer grinder instead of running it continuously to prevent the motor from overheating.

## **Jar 2: Blending Jar**

Blending jars are another essential jars that make up crucial **mixer parts**. True to its name, it blends liquids and makes smoothies, shakes, and purees. The blending jar is usually made of polycarbonate material, which is lightweight and shatterproof.

Depending on the mixer grinder's capacity, the blending jar comes in different sizes, ranging from small to large. The small blending jar has a capacity of 0.5-0.75 liters, while the larger jar can hold up to 1.5-2 liters of liquids. The blending jar usually has a tight-fitting lid that prevents spills and splatters during the blending process.

When using the blending jar, it is essential to ensure the ingredients are not too hot or cold. Hot liquids can cause pressure to build up inside the jar, leading to the lid popping off or the contents spilling out. Cold liquids can cause the blades to become dull and blunt over time. Adding the liquids and solid ingredients to ensure that everything blends evenly is also recommended.

## **Jar 3: Chutney Jar**

The chutney jar is a small jar used to make chutneys, sauces, and dips. It is usually made of stainless steel or polycarbonate material and comes with sharp blades that can efficiently grind small quantities of ingredients. The chutney jar typically has a capacity of between 0.3 to 0.5 liters and is perfect for grinding small quantities of ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Some mixer grinders also come with a separate small jar that can be used for grinding spices.

**Summing Up**

The **mixer 3 jar** is an essential component that makes the appliance a versatile and multi-functional kitchen tool. Whether you want to blend smoothies, grind spices or chop vegetables, each jar is designed to cater to specific tasks, making it easy to achieve the desired results. Knowing how to use the three jars in a mixer grinder properly can significantly affect your cooking quality. By following the manufacturer's instructions and using the suitable jar for the task, you can ensure that your mixer grinder delivers optimal performance and longevity.
