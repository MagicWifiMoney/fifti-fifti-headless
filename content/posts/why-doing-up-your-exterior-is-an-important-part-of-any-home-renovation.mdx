Having an outdoor space is becoming more and more of a novelty. With most people today buying apartments out of sheer necessity than ever before, it’s time to really celebrate the exterior of our properties. Having a front yard and back garden is a true privilege, and if you aren’t actively doing anything with those spaces, your home value will never reach its true potential. 

## Benefits of Exterior Improvements 

Doing up your home’s exterior offers so many key benefits as well. The first and foremost is, of course, that it’s one of the easiest ways to [increase your home’s value](https://www.houselogic.com/save-money-add-value/add-value-to-your-home/adding-curb-appeal-value-to-home/){data-affiliate="1175"}. This is done in two ways. One, by actually raising the valuation of your property and two, by making it an attractive option to encourage a bidding war. 

Sprucing up your property is also great for improving how you feel. Coming home after a long day at work and seeing a well put together home that makes you feel comfortable is honestly priceless. You may also find that you’re happier to have people over, and are, in general, prouder of your property as a whole. 

The final benefit is that it simply improves your street! This in turn can encourage other homeowners to do the same, because they like the look of yours so much. When enough people do it, the entire value of the street itself goes up, which is a win-win for everyone. 

You can improve your exterior with DIY projects or bring on a contractor to really go for the wow. Regardless, you will want to go through a few essential steps in advance, so that any changes you make are done properly. 

## **How to Improve Your Exterior **

Sprucing up your home’s exterior is absolutely well worth your time, but to make sure that you get the most out of your efforts, you’ll want to tackle the items listed below: 

- **Deep Clean It **

The first step is to get it deep cleaned. [Driveway cleaning by Cheshire Pressure](https://cheshirepressure.com/){data-affiliate="1176"} can breathe a whole new life into what you may have thought was a lost cause. If you have tiled or mosaics for your driveway, properly deep cleaning it can immediately make it look like new. You’ll also want to deep clean any concrete, the gutters, the window trim and more so that everything sparkles. 

- **Make Key Repairs**

One of the best parts about deep cleaning is that the issues come to the surface. This makes it easy to focus on the repairs that matter most. Start first with any issues that could end up causing structural damage, like an eaten-away foundation, and then work your way up to the small cosmetic touch-ups. 

- **Start Decorating **

If you think that you need to bring in a huge landscaping project in order to get a great looking space, think again. Sometimes all you need is a little bit of imagination, and décor. You can make do with what the previous owners have done and then [spruce it up with potted plants](https://salisburygreenhouse.com/how-to-use-plants-to-decorate-your-patio/){data-affiliate="1177"}, plant beds, great lights, and even better furniture.
