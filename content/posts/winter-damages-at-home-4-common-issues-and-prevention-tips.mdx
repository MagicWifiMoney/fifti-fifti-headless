As much as you love the winter season, you will agree that it has pros and cons. The pile of snow outside and the freezing temperature causes damage to your home inside out. 

In simple words, the winter season puts your home to the test, from the kitchen pipes to appliances and cement on the driveway. Endless problems are caused at home because of the cold weather.

Therefore, we’ve come up with this article, wherein we mention the most common winter issues at home and significant ways to fix them. Read on to prepare well before the damage can hamper your everyday living. 

## 1. Heater Breakout 

Heater breakdowns are the scariest among all the winter issues because you won’t get hot water in the freezing cold. It is certainly not a good thing to happen to anyone. The main reason behind heater breakouts is the loss of pressure, a worn ignition burner, or a faulty pipe. The warning signs specifying a problem in the boiler include loud bangs, leaks, and water not heating up.  

If you ever encounter this situation, you should call for professionals to repair the issue. Moreover, according to [Barnett Plumbing and Water Heaters](https://www.philbarnettplumbing.com/newark-water-heaters/){data-affiliate="784"} experts, shifting to hybrid water heaters is proving effective for homeowners. They are energy efficient and easy to install. In addition, they are at low risk of getting burnout. 

## 2. **Peeling Paint **

You must have seen paint peeling off from different areas in your home, especially in the winter season. The leading cause of this cold-weather problem is condensation due to insufficient ventilation. According to reports, the search for peeling paint increased by a significant percentage on the internet. 

To [prevent such an issue](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/paint/how-tos/how-to-fix-peeling-paint/){data-affiliate="785"}, you must use a paint formulated explicitly for withstanding cold temperatures. In addition, you should check for proper insulation and moisture barriers before the winter kicks in. Likewise, check if there are any leakages in the roof so the water does not enter the walls to damage the paint. 

## 3. **Leaks in the Basement **

Basement flooding is a common household issue. It can happen in any weather. However, during the winters, the melting ice and snow can enter the basement through the cracks. As a result, there can be basement flooding or structural damage to your home. 

The best way to prevent this uncalled-for situation is to check the basement condition before winter. Likewise, you should ensure that the sump pump is working correctly. Other factors like gutters and drains also play a vital role. So, ensure there is a proper outway for melted ice. 

## 4. **Damage to the Deck **

Your home’s deck is well-prepared to withstand different elements. However, it is not immune to winter damage. Thus, the winter moisture on it creates a breeding ground for mildew and mold in your home. The snow collected on the deck causes the water and can also cause [discoloration of the deck](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/deck-staining-problems-49421.html){data-affiliate="786"}. 

To prevent this, you must ensure that all the snow is cleared using a plastic shovel or a stiff broom to avoid any scratching on the deck. Many people also use a tarp to cover the deck and prevent it from any damage throughout the winter season. 

## Winterize Your Home 

We hope the above information helps winterize your home and prevent damage. It will allow you to save money and resources.
