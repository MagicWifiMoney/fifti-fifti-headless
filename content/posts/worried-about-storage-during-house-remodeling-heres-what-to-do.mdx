It is often said that *“Living through home remodeling is no less than living in the wild; you have to do whatever it takes to survive.”* And it is definitely true to an extent. Remodeling your house means improving its aesthetics, increasing the property’s value, and adding positivity and a brand new look to your beloved place. However, all these are the post-remodeling perks. What are your thoughts about the pre-remodeling phase? 

Truth to be told, the pre-phase includes planning about the upgrade and looking for solutions to manage your household items, especially bulky items, including furniture and other fixtures. Not every household has adequate space to maintain these items and is clutter-free. That’s why house upgrades tend to turn into a hassle. Not anymore! Continue reading to find a few practice options to store household items during a home remodeling. 

## Use Your Car Garage

Household garages generally have ample space, sometimes so much that it could be easier used as a separate room. You can use this available space to keep your belongings safe and well organized. Pack all your necessary stuff in boxes, label them, and store them in the garage. Make sure to look for any [signs of moisture](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/check-moisture-inside-walls-35175.html){data-affiliate="526"}, mold, or other issues before you keep your items there, especially if the garage has not been used much. A clean and well-maintained garage will ensure the safety of your items. 

**Tip:** You can also consider keeping your items in another room while one room is under work. This way, you can alternate between different rooms to keep the household items safe and well-stored. 

## Use Storage Units

Storage units come in quite handy when you have to keep your valuable and bulky items safe. Suppose you are renovating your vacation home in St Petersburg, Florida. In that case, you can look for self-[storage units in St Petersburg Florida](https://www.thelockup.com/self-storage-st.petersburg-florida){data-affiliate="527"}, that offer you a range of units depending on your requirements. You can select a large two-car garage unit if you need to store your furniture, car, or any other big item. These units are often monitored and have climate-controlled storage. So, you need not worry about your items getting damaged, stolen, or lost. 

## Rent A Portable Container

Another storage option available to you is to rent a portable container. These are also quite big; thus, they fulfill your different types of storehouse requirements. The best part is that these containers are delivered to your house whenever you need to get anything or add a new item. It will help save your time and streamline [the renovation process](https://www.bhg.com/home-improvement/advice/planning/read-this-before-you-start-your-home-renovation-281474979547593/){data-affiliate="528"} to an extent. 

## Ask Your Neighbors And Friends For Help

Last but not least, you can take help from your neighbors and friends to keep your small household items such as decor pieces, laptops, or other appliances. As the items are small, it is likely not to cause any major inconvenience to your neighbors or friends. In return for their favor, you can give them a heartfelt present to show your appreciation. 

**Wrapping It All Up**

These are a few practical options that you can try to store your household items. Nevertheless, it would come in handy to plan the remodeling process properly and store the items beforehand. It will facilitate the up-gradation process for the professionals as well as provide you peace of mind.
